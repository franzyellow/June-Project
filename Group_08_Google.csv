Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4
0,3.6,5.58,8,,,,
1,5.97,8.04,8,,Or is it,,
2,8.07,11.55,8,,Yeah green is for twenty,,
3,13.08,15.21,8,,,Ok so now,
4,15.45,18.21,8,,,I'll just take these off and then we can have a little bit more,
5,18.93,22.5,8,Sorry,,I am your in control ,
6,22.65,24.63,8,,,It's ok,
7,25.74,29.31,8,Can I add the red one or blue one here maybe it might be thirty,,Cause yeah,
8,32.52,35.67,8,,So twenty that's thirty,,
9,36.9,38.88,8,,,Yeah  ,
10,42.6,48.72,8,Yeah so the blue one is thirty,,I mean the fact that it's teetering back and forth it's close enough they're just increments of ten grams,
11,48.78,51.75,8,,Blue is thirty big blue is thirty,Yeah,
12,51.87,54.33,8,,,So it's thirty here,
13,56.55,64.86,8,Did we measure we didn't measure the yellow just keep one,Did we measure we didn't measure the the yellow one right we might,Oh I thought ok,
14,65.67,67.95,8,And keep the thirty,,,
15,67.98,73.95,8,,Let's try both the green ones now I mean both the big ones yeah,Let's try,
16,74.07,76.05,8,Oh that's too heavy,Too heavy,,
17,76.41,78.45,8,Try the right,,,
18,78.51,80.61,8,Keep that one,,,
19,84.75,88.17,8,,What if we do the green one and the two smaller cubes,,
20,88.53,91.26,8,,Cause that's going to be pushing that way,,
21,91.53,95.79,8,This is twenty or thirty,,Gotcha are they centered,
22,96.06,99.69,8,,Yeah I feel that way,Let's just make sure I guess they are centered these are ten,
23,100.05,106.77,8,,Green green is twenty so green is twenty and then we said this one is thirty right,Green is twenty ok green is twenty thirty yeah,
24,107.01,108.99,8,But let's see let's,,,
25,114.15,117,8,Needs more weight,,,
26,117.36,119.58,8,Let's try forty,,,
27,119.76,126.39,8,,That's too light and we know that green is equal to,,
28,126.42,128.4,8,,This one and that one,,
29,128.94,131.25,8,,So let's try this one too,,
30,132,134.91,8,Oh it's more than forty,,,
31,136.23,141.09,8,,,So let's see oh wait it's leaning now,
32,141.12,143.19,8,,,,
33,144.78,146.76,8,Between forty and fifty,,,
34,155.4,162.21,8,Yeah it's more than forty,It's definitely not staying in between right,But which one was forty I'm just,
35,162.3,164.88,8,This is thirty this is twenty,Yeah twenty,Thirty ok,
36,165.72,168.09,8,This is more than forty,So what if we do,,
37,168.21,170.67,8,But we don't and less than fifty actually,,,
38,171.39,173.97,8,,,Yeah,
39,174.33,177.18,8,Twenty plus ten thirty,,Yeah,
40,178.17,180.15,8,Forty,,,
41,183.93,186.24,8,,,,
42,187.98,190.38,8,Forty,,,
43,191.28,194.13,8,Fifty,Fifty so heavy or,,
44,194.46,196.62,8,Fifty is too heavy,,,
45,197.1,204.87,8,Yeah it is between forty and fifty,Like can swe use a combination of,I mean it could be just like how they were placed on like measured at like I don't know,
46,206.07,212.19,8,We tried all of the combinations yeah yeah we can try this,So we can move one of these,We can't we can't get between so,
47,213.6,215.58,8,,,Yeah but,
48,215.97,220.35,8,We can add weight,,We know it's between forty and fifty we can't really,
49,220.5,224.4,8,,Yeah,Cause everything else we know is like a multiple of ten so we just can't,
50,225.06,231.03,8,Actually just adding one gram made it equal,,Directly compare it um,
51,232.47,234.45,8,I just added one gram,,,
52,234.93,237.9,8,,Oh yeah cause it's a scale yeah so,Yeah,
53,237.93,243.21,8,So it's forty one,Yeah forty one,,
54,246.3,248.52,8,,So should we,,
55,248.55,252.9,8,I think actually everything is not round figured,Where should we put it then in forty,,
56,253.23,258.84,8,Presume because they didn't come to that sect right shall we try to measure it accurately,,,
57,259.11,261.87,8,Precisely,,Wait so is this just in the wrong place or is this the twenty,
58,263.01,272.73,8,,,Is this in the wrong place or is this ok so this is thirty fifty minus one so ,
59,272.91,278.28,8,Ok minus one it is yeah so it is forty nine yeah forty nine yeah,Minus one forty nine,,
60,280.2,284.04,8,,,Ok so it's probably meant to be just fifty and was placed differently,
61,284.34,286.32,8,,,And callibrate it,
62,287.28,289.59,8,,,Did you hear that,
63,292.62,294.6,8,,,,
64,295.35,298.41,8,,,I think we're done,
65,298.65,302.94,8,No,,,Have you filled out the survey on the computer as well and you guys will be 
66,305.13,308.76,8,,,,
67,310.2,315.48,8,Should we be precise to one gram,,Should we double check anything or just assume that we got it ,
68,316.92,323.37,8,Should we tenths length ok that's fine yeah,Ok so fifty is fine,,Just do rounding to tenths
69,323.49,326.25,8,,,Yeah we just got stumped cause it was like,
70,326.28,328.44,8,,,Plus,
71,329.73,333.66,8,,Yeah,Yeah so we're definitely right,
72,336.18,348,8,Yeah,So yellow is fifty they said yellow's cause it was forty so yellow's fifty green is twenty,So you want to just like tell me the numbers cause,
73,349.74,352.02,8,,Um purple is thirty,,
74,353.88,358.05,8,,Yeah and and um what's the other one blue blue is ten,,
75,359.16,365.25,8,,Yeah I was like yeah I was like kind of confused wait what the lighting but,,
76,365.91,368.13,8,,So red is ten,Fifty,
77,369.09,371.07,8,,Was thirty yep,,
78,371.1,373.5,8,,Um green is twenty and then yellow,,
79,374.7,376.68,8,,,,
80,379.32,381.81,8,White block,Ok which way,,
81,382.26,384.24,8,,,Mystery block,
82,384.3,396.57,8,Is there any mystery block third weight,,,Ok now you need to determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
83,396.75,399.24,8,,,,You will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
84,399.27,405.57,8,It's like um,,Ok so it might have to do with the numbers and stuff but,And you can now begin
85,405.84,410.1,8,I think it's for data reference I don't know,,Either that or we could just,
86,410.79,413.64,8,,,So let's read the numbers to see if we can,
87,413.82,415.8,8,,,Notice a pattern,
88,417.48,421.38,8,,Interesting I was definitely right yeah it's definitely,,
89,421.77,424.95,8,,Hundred and fifty grams but um,,
90,425.1,428.34,8,,I mean we could use a combination of these,,
91,429.96,438.81,8,Actually since the like the density is different we can actually compare directly,To see you know how to,,
92,439.71,442.56,8,,,Yeah but let's make sure we don't lose our order,
93,442.74,450.81,8,Um yeah green is twenty yep let's check that,,Um and if you notice they all have this kind of stuff written on them so maybe this is,
94,451.47,453.99,8,,Well they all say the same thing,,
95,454.56,456.63,8,,They all say,,
96,458.4,460.38,8,They all say the same thing actually,,,
97,460.62,464.37,8,,So I don't think it matters um,Gotcha  ,
98,466.05,475.38,8,,,We can feel a hole right here so maybe we can see how much is drilled out as well,
99,475.53,479.76,8,This has a forty now give me the thirty one,,I don't want to do math right now ,
100,481.65,484.77,8,It is twenty one second,,,
101,485.07,487.05,8,Yeah this is thirty,,,
102,489.6,491.58,8,It has a hole,,,
103,491.94,495.03,8,,,,
104,495.63,498.54,8,,Or let's all like do what he's doing,,
105,498.6,506.25,8,,And like like so like we all get a feel and then we could all come up with like a result,Yeah I guess yeah,
106,507.36,515.46,8,,,And do you think that like one of us should just like keep them stable so that you're only feeling the weight just cause otherwise one's going to be like less stable I don't know if that'll make a difference,
107,516.57,519.93,8,Um uh remove the ten,,,
108,525.21,527.64,8,It's that yeah,Want me to add the green,,
109,527.76,529.74,8,Try that,,,
110,532.65,536.04,8,And that just a little bit try that,,,
111,538.29,540.51,8,,,,
112,545.52,547.5,8,,,,
113,547.89,550.17,8,,Lowkey add a ten,,
114,552.33,554.31,8,,,,
115,561.63,564.15,8,,Another ten,,
116,569.55,571.53,8,,Too heavy,,
117,574.98,580.92,8,Because after a volume more volume we can't actually,,,
118,584.85,586.83,8,,,,
119,587.34,589.8,8,,That feels more like it I'm going to be honest,,
120,589.92,592.56,8,,,And then can we like,
121,592.59,594.57,8,,,Makeshift our own sort of like,
122,594.9,601.05,8,,,A way of actually measuring it like with a scale like set up something that will have a tipping point or are we supposed do this by feel,
123,602.76,604.74,8,,,,You guys are free to solve the task as 
124,606,608.31,8,,,Ok,
125,608.58,611.28,8,,,Uh it's this one we want now,
126,612.24,624.09,8,We also try that that is fair if it is the rectangle we can try that,,We are like halfway over the edge and we can just barely balance it actually we need something bigger,
127,625.62,628.35,8,,,So like what's going to get just like barely,
128,630.6,632.94,8,,,,
129,635.61,637.89,8,It started falling,,,
130,639,643.02,8,,,,
131,643.71,647.58,8,,,I think that it needs more,
132,648.45,650.43,8,,Leave the same size though,,
133,651.54,653.88,8,,,Uh the bottom one shouldn't matter,
134,653.91,657.09,8,,,In then as long as we have the same on either side of that line,
135,657.42,660.81,8,,,Stacking up,
136,664.8,666.78,8,,,How close is this though,
137,667.65,676.17,8,,I think that was on the line too,That might have been it that was three ,
138,676.92,681.48,8,Fifty plus,So we said like green was ten green was twenty,Let's see,
139,681.84,685.11,8,Fifty plus,Yellow was fifty,I think that might be it should we do it again just to be sure,
140,685.17,687.87,8,,Yeah,Ok,
141,688.56,691.26,8,Keep it in that sect diagnal,,,
142,693.57,697.62,8,,,Wait a sec ok so this actually matters how we,
143,705.06,707.43,8,,,,
144,708.39,711.24,8,,,Well that's pretty unstable right there I think,
145,712.02,714,8,,Yeah right there all right,,
146,714.84,716.82,8,,Good enough at approximation,,
147,719.01,720.99,8,,,,
148,722.61,727.35,8,,,Set it like all the way into the center line it's just enough room to support it,
149,727.62,730.98,8,,,And I'll just kind of support this with my finger and then I'll move my finger,
150,731.34,733.53,8,,,Like if I don't feel weight we can just see how,
151,733.98,735.96,8,,,,
152,744.72,747.12,8,,,And so that's not close but it'll be,
153,747.18,749.16,8,,,That,
154,749.85,758.07,8,If we add it ,How much weight is that if you yeah I think you,I think if we add another one here but we want to make sure it looks like it's straight up and down also,
155,765.33,773.49,8,,So it's the yellow which was fifty grams right yellow purple,So I think that's it,
156,773.52,776.46,8,,Purple and a yellow green,,
157,776.61,780.78,8,Yes,And red right yellow green,,
158,780.96,783.06,8,,Ten,,
159,783.15,785.43,8,,Green  ,,
160,786.39,790.23,8,,,Do they have that or like maybe ten more I just couldn't quite tell,
161,790.89,795.21,8,,,It didn't seem like it took it much to get it to tip,
162,795.42,800.49,8,Twenty thirty fifty,,Yield ten grams of pressure I think it's that,
163,800.76,803.37,8,We have two answers right we can give eighty and ninety,,,
164,805.23,807.78,8,,So seventy yeah we could try eighty,,
165,807.96,810.3,8,Yeah we can try eighty,Right in the middle,,
166,811.32,813.57,8,,,I don't I don't think it was in the,
167,814.02,820.47,8,This this and this twenty and fifty,Yeah,Wait what were the ones that we had on there cause I think that might have been the same,
168,820.74,825.66,8,Added a ten,,Ok well we added an we used both of these so it's twenty twenty and fifty so fifty,
169,825.84,831.99,8,Try ninety ninety yeah,Yeah let's have another try,Ninety let's see are we good with ninety,
170,836.07,838.05,8,Then you can try eighty,,,
171,839.67,842.49,8,We can't add more,,I don't think we have eighty,
172,842.7,846.69,8,Actually when we added the final ten it was able to to fall,It started to tip,,
173,846.75,851.19,8,,,It was about ready to fall but it didn't fall it needed to be touched so maybe it was a hundred,
174,851.82,855.99,8,Ok we can try that,,,
175,857.88,862.35,8,It was eighty,Uh it was eighty yep,Oh ok,
176,862.56,864.81,8,,Yeah cause,That's interesting,
177,865.2,870.24,8,,If you were to add another ten pounds to make it a hundred it would have definitely tilted over,Twenty forty,
178,872.67,879.9,8,,,,Ok for the final part of the task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery
179,880.71,889.47,8,Is it the second mystery block,Ok cool we could use this,,You'll have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey um you will have a scenario on the
180,890.82,892.8,8,Just right there,Just click next,,
181,902.76,906.3,8,,,,
182,907.89,911.28,8,There is no mystery block but we need to estimate the weight of it,,,
183,914.34,917.79,8,Oh everytime it caught item multiplied,,,
184,918.45,927.69,8,Or doubled twenty plus twenty twenty plus thirty fifty plus thirty eighty,,,
185,928.02,930,8,Eighty plus fifty one thirty,,,
186,931.44,934.8,8,You got my point see we have,,,
187,937.8,945,8,Understand the question,Create the wooden block do not send we have to,A second mystery block so I'm just wondering which two are moving about,
188,945.93,953.91,8,We don't have a mystery block the company forgot to send the block when you do estimate what the mystery block's weight was without knowing,It's just so we have to pass the meter,,
189,954,955.98,8,Even knowing what it is,,,
190,956.82,963.93,8,My estimate was like we have two tens when we add two tens we get a twenty when you get twenty plus ten we get a thirty,,,
191,964.26,968.61,8,When you add thirty plus twenty we get fifty when you add fifty plus thirty we get eighty,,,
192,968.73,971.31,8,When we add eighty plus fifty we get one thirty,,,
193,972.42,980.64,8,Yeah that's what I think yeah that is how they are getting you incrementing,Cause it's like the rate right of like how we're incrementing or I agree I would go with one thirty as well,Oh gotcha,
194,982.38,984.36,8,What do you think,,,
195,984.96,989.19,8,,Yeah makes sense cause two tens make up a twenty,I think you're definitely right,
196,989.22,991.41,8,Yeah then you can explain it,,,
197,993.48,1002,8,If you have any idea you can say it actually,,Um I just forget the name of what it's called I don't want to like write it out,
198,1003.17,1007.37,8,Um you can call it a sequence,,What's that like pattern called um,
199,1009.05,1016.07,8,Actually the blocks start with the sequence of ten plus ten twenty twenty plus ten thirty you can explain that,,,
200,1020.51,1027.83,8,,,Yeah but there's an infinite sequence I mean you can write that out I just want to keep trying to think of the name because that would be probably easier,
201,1030.92,1033.26,8,,Once,,
202,1034.31,1036.92,8,,,,
203,1036.95,1039.02,8,,,,
204,1039.08,1041.27,8,,,,
205,1047.15,1049.73,8,,,Each block is the sum of the heaviest two,
206,1050.18,1052.82,8,,,New block,
207,1055.76,1058.25,8,,,I don't know,
208,1059.63,1063.05,8,,,,
209,1063.77,1066.32,8,,,Ah Fibonacci sequence,
210,1067.34,1071.51,8,,,The weights are so far we have ten times,
211,1071.63,1077.87,8,,,Each value to like one two three four five six of the Fibonacci sequence,
212,1079.31,1083.6,8,,,So yeah that was very perceptive nice job,
213,1090.98,1093.23,8,,,,
214,1099.02,1101.69,8,Fifty and eighty right,,,
215,1111.74,1116.99,8,,,,
216,1122.96,1127.52,8,,,,
217,1128,1134.54,8,I type so much,,,
218,1141.71,1143.69,8,,,,
219,1162.53,1164.51,8,,,,
220,1166.1,1168.59,8,,And eighty so we're expecting,,
221,1171.53,1176.33,8,,,Yeah I mean I guess we don't really have a sequential order for,
222,1177.11,1181.97,8,,,All of them except oh wait did she give us to the blocks one by one,
223,1182.72,1186.17,8,Did they throw it up,,Cause we could just say that,
224,1186.62,1190.58,8,,,They're all like ten grams times,
225,1191.24,1195.74,8,One two three five,,Some number in the first one two three four five six,
226,1196.22,1200.99,8,,,Like numbers from the Fibonacci seuquence so we expect it to be ten grams times to the seventh,
227,1202.73,1213.71,8,Um I don't understant actually you say that one even if it's the same right again if you write ten into one one comma one comma two comma,,Um but it's just cause we don't have orders of the ones that we got first,
228,1214.07,1217.94,8,Three comma five comma eight it's second Fibonacci,,I don't know I'm like,
229,1219.5,1224.81,8,No it's like this and we sorted them,,But did she give us the blocks one though sorry I'm like literally half asleep right now,
