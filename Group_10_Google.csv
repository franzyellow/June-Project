Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4
0,4.02,9.6,10,,,Oh okay. Sorry.,Oh I'm just
1,14.67,19.08,10,,,,The test that you are completing today is called the weights test.
2,19.71,22.41,10,,,,part one you will work together to determine the weights
3,24.27,27.03,10,,,,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams.
4,27.6,30.24,10,,,,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the
5,30.3,33.9,10,,,,scale here. All of the weights are intervals of ten grams
6,34.08,36.45,10,,,,so you don't need to use the slider
7,36.57,40.77,10,,,,um and the scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop
8,41.22,43.2,10,,,,the weights are fairly equal
9,43.68,46.47,10,,,,place the cubes onto this worksheet
10,46.89,51.15,10,,,,determined their weight and also enter their weight in the survey on the computer.
11,52.05,54.99,10,,,,Uh you can now start the survey. You guys are gonna be group number ten.
12,55.32,57.9,10,,Yeah.,Okay so the red is ten grams?,
13,57.93,60.21,10,So I suppose like,,Okay.  ,
14,60.48,63.06,10,Let's assume that the bigger,,,
15,63.15,66.06,10,ones are um,,,
16,66.6,70.68,10,,put two here. Are we gonna put another one red one as well.,,
17,71.22,73.2,10,,,Hmmm.,
18,74.04,76.02,10,,why that selection?,,
19,78.12,83.1,10,Yeah I suppose.,Hopefully,I guess this is like twenty and this is like ten and ten.,
20,83.25,90.45,10,Yeah. Are they the. They're the same.,Uhhhh I just don't like that yet.,what why didn't we first check out whether these two are equal. Or of equal size but,
21,90.69,93.48,10,,,,
22,96.51,98.49,10,,,It looks like they're fairly equal.,
23,100.2,103.53,10,,Yeah I suppose.,Right so then that's twenty these two are ten.,
24,104.4,106.74,10,That would make sense to me.,,,
25,108.33,112.11,10,,Just a sec let it settle for the,Mmhmm,
26,115.32,117.3,10,,,Hmmm.,
27,117.42,119.58,10,,Yeah they're together.,fairly equal to me yeah.,
28,119.7,130.32,10,You can just,Yeah they're they're equal. Heavier. So let's put the ten one ten.,Alright. Well now let's do these two. I can already tell this one's heavier yeah.,
29,130.44,132.42,10,,put one ten.,,
30,132.63,134.61,10,,Let's see.,,
31,136.08,145.17,10,I say they are equal. Those are the instructions I suppose,Yeah fairly equal but let's see.,We gotta be.,
32,146.4,150.66,10,,Yeah.,Try this one out as well like after some time wait wait wait let's let's see if it balances.,
33,151.62,153.6,10,,,Cause I have a feeling this is a little more.,
34,157.92,164.37,10,I'm not sure was uh just a bit more like we would be able to tell the difference.,Just a second just a sec,,
35,166.65,170.58,10,,Yeah yeah yeah yeah. Just a sec.,Like you would be able to see it right?,
36,170.64,173.7,10,,Stop now please.,,
37,180.9,203.37,10,,I'm guessing it's a little bit to the left a little bit to the left like It touches the red line but on the left hand side of the left line red it's gonna be heavier Like not equal but almost almost equal. How do wait how do we know this one's twenty did we. no we didn't,Yeah. so let's try to put that on top and see Okay so it's definitely not like fourty. Like thirty two thirty three what do you say. Cause this one's twenty this one's ten Cause we did it.,
38,203.43,217.8,10,To begin with also like we don't really have time to do this.,We we moved it and checked the two tens remember we didn't do this one. Okay yeah sure sure sure yeah yeah put thirty. Thirty yeah,Yeah but then when we have the two yeah. Yeah. yeah so I would say around thirty two or something.,
39,217.98,220.92,10,,Thirty one thirty two so thirty,So okay. Cool.,
40,222.72,225.96,10,Um you know what let's try this.,,What's left.,
41,226.44,228.93,10,,,Okay.  ,
42,234.06,236.04,10,Do these make sense,,,
43,241.02,243,10,,,,
44,247.62,253.77,10,Twenty.,So this one's thirty and what's this one twenty right. Twenty okay so this one's gonna be fifty,Mmhmm. Twenty Yeah.,
45,254.58,256.56,10,,,,
46,260.22,263.07,10,,Almost there.,,
47,263.7,269.79,10,,It's more tilting to the right so less than fifty,I mean it's not gonna go anywhere I guess it's just. Oh.,
48,269.94,274.14,10,,But there's no like I mean between weights so fifty.,Okay,
49,274.38,276.66,10,,Do you wanna try any tens anywhere,,
50,277.71,283.89,10,,Just a sec let this settle now. Yeah.,This is gonna be too heavy I think this is around yeah.,
51,283.92,286.92,10,,This is like less than fifty less than fifty.,Fifty,
52,287.1,291.18,10,,Less than fifty,Like if those are more than fifty then this is less. Yeah.,
53,291.78,293.76,10,,,,
54,294.42,302.22,10,Makes sense if,,I guess we're done huh. I just want to feel it though I really want to see if it's the heaviest,
55,302.52,306.45,10,,Yeah yeah it's it's almost settled down so it's less than fifty,Should I Oh yeah this is,
56,306.51,312.75,10,So this was thirty right. Thirty this was twenty and these are tens ,Yeah. Twenty,fifty grams. Okay.  ,
57,312.96,315.84,10,,and that's fifty,Fifty,
58,317.04,319.59,10,,and yeah So that's it,,
59,319.65,322.86,10,,Hopefully,Well we have more weights here,
60,322.89,327,10,This not it,,Like one fourty But no blocks,
61,327.78,335.22,10,What are we supposed to do we are supposed do. We are supposed to enter it in the laptop,,Do you have more blocks or I think we're done here. Oh okay let's do that,
62,335.64,337.62,10,,Ten I guess,Group number ten,
63,342.78,351.21,10,Fifty. Yeah. Twenty,So the yellow one's fifty. Yeah. Green wait green's twenty,okay Now help me out Fifty. Okay green,
64,352.02,359.37,10,And theyíre two blue,Tens tens are blue blue and red yup,Okay,
65,359.76,366.33,10,,Purple's this one thirty,blue and reds well they don't have the right uh purple Thirty right yeah alright let's do it,
66,366.42,368.88,10,you know what like I feel that,,,
67,369.3,373.59,10,this what the other thing too is purple because blue and red makes purple right,,,
68,373.71,383.79,10,There are four options so,No no no no. So like they gave the weight of this one they gave the weight of the red one so that's why they didn't include this one they already gave us yeah,No I think this is this is the one which is purple. Oh.,
69,383.94,386.46,10,,,lets go ahead and hit this.,
70,387.81,391.47,10,,Yeah red ten given,red is ten grams  yellow is fifty grams ,
71,391.89,394.38,10,,,Green is twenty I mean we're we're right right,
72,394.44,397.56,10,,Uh yeah let's see,I mean we're exactly right,
73,398.22,403.77,10,,Yeah yeah yeah we're we're right,No the red is ten blue is ten yellow is fifty. Okay.,
74,405.3,407.76,10,,Where is the mystery block Any idea,,
75,407.85,421.38,10,You have two attempts. It's heavier than everything else,Okay. okay we remove the scale,Indicate the weight of the mystery block. Whoa. Where is the blue guy,Determine the weight of this mystery block. Um you guys will have two attempts
76,421.5,429.33,10,,Two attempts okay. Wait this one is what again fifty. This is this is,This is fifty. That's, to enter the data correctly into the survey
77,429.54,432.48,10,Thirty Twenty,Okay just a sec,That's that was thirty,
78,433.14,446.94,10,I would say still,Can we form something on one side like this place the other one. So okay yeah,Well just just try to get a feel of It.,
79,447.12,451.95,10,heavier than all these blocks. Yeah can you grab there and hold it,Okay really. Really,Really,
80,456.69,459.27,10,,So the yellow one's,,
81,460.92,464.31,10,,thirty twenty ten ten okay. Just a sec,,
82,465.51,467.91,10,,,Almost the same.,
83,468.42,470.4,10,,,Fifty thirty twenty,
84,470.52,477.09,10,Fifty thirty eighty,like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess.,hundred and ten like a hundred or a hundred and ten that would be my guess.,
85,477.48,489.06,10,hundred. so like one thirty or one fourty,how are you. how are you really holding I'm just moving blocks and seeing. Yeah this is lighter this is lighter. If I put the ten,This is hard to say,
86,491.37,493.53,10,Yeah,Still lighter,,
87,497.31,499.47,10,,Comparatively less lighter but,,
88,499.68,501.66,10,,Same,,
89,502.17,509.97,10,Umm. Do you want to try like one thirty,Like like wait let's remove these two let's check This one is lighter right on the right side,Let me try,
90,510.96,515.46,10,,,It's hard it really it's hard to say because,
91,515.58,518.82,10,,,depends on how strong your hands are both hands so,
92,519.3,528.57,10,,How much is it so we have fifty thirty eighty. ten hundred hundred and twenty,I don't know like ninety or maybe a hundred you know it could be is my guess. We have a hundred and ten,
93,528.66,535.32,10,,Because two tens. Two tens there's two. so the thing is like if we put this also feels lighter right,Oh we have two okay. Okay,
94,536.7,544.17,10,Yeah uh maybe not. Difficult it is um,Maybe not. Just a sec okay,,
95,545.46,548.43,10,,Yeah it's lighter but this,,
96,550.14,555.84,10,This is um this whole block is one twenty right so,Almost same. let's let's do it,Okay,
97,555.93,561.69,10,Where do we wanna,Yeah,I think one twenty and one ten would be a good idea because we have two chances,
98,562.47,569.7,10,I I was thinking maybe a little bit higher instead of lower but that also makes sense because I don't know any better.,,Right. Oh. okay.,
99,572.13,574.11,10,,see this,,
100,575.22,578.34,10,,This feels same almost try it,Oh let's try it out,
101,581.19,589.68,10,It's strange that like you are saying that all of these stacked up were all identical to that and now these ,No no no no,Hundred and ten so that's like a hundred,
102,589.74,605.79,10,I mean this is very difficult why don't we just guess,No no no no so the thing is like when you put this it feels almost same because it's just ten gram difference that's why. Let let's try it. Yeah,So that that would put it at like a hundred. Because that one would be a hundred and ten and this is a hundred ten so that's hundred,
103,606.06,610.2,10,,fifty thirty eighty hundred hundred and ten over there,,
104,610.32,614.22,10,,hundred and ten yeah let's put hundred and ten let's see what happens,,
105,614.79,629.91,10,Yeah,No wait wait this is hundred this is hundred this is hundred So means hundred and ten is total this. Yeah. Okay yeah sure sure sure sure yeah,Well If we're going to put a hundred and ten. What. No that's what I said this is alone it's it's hundred but what do you want to do first I think we should go with a hundred and ten first. Then if y'all agree we can go with a hundred next right,
106,630.3,632.82,10,,Sure let's see,,
107,634.32,640.62,10,,The brain is,Okay this is okay,
108,641.07,651.99,10,weights of the prior blocks and use it oh okay. So these are ten ten twenty. Thirty,Prior blocks,Okay this is not quite correct. So between the weights of the,
109,652.2,667.29,10,Fifty it's Fibonacci or something right. One one two three five. Wait eight eighty maybe. Yeah,ten ten thirty fifty ,Wait wait what's. Two three five eight thirteen twenty. Eighty. Yeah that's Fibonacci definitely,
110,667.68,674.46,10,Ah I mean that's,Ten ten this is what twenty right one plus one two yup two plus one three yup,,
111,674.55,677.91,10,,three plus two five oh yeah that's fifty,,
112,677.94,692.22,10,Like maybe we can find a pattern,and five plus three eight yeah let's go for eighty then. That's a pattern that's it,Like just because of just becasuse that's Fibonacci. Because I'm not sure what this hint is this is saying relationship between the weights,
113,692.31,706.44,10,I'm not sure how far we can get by using the weight,Yeah it's. is is there any other series I'm not missing out I mean ten twenty thirty fifty,which means Is that the pattern or is that you know just use those weights. Right. That that is true anyway. And also I mean,
114,706.59,710.52,10,,,We don't really have to be correct I mean we're trying to be correct but,
115,711.21,722.31,10,Yeah but also like I can't judge anything by just holding things,,But eighty is a big difference like you know from a hundred to an eighty. Well let's try to see if there is a hint here,
116,722.52,726.36,10,,,This is eight RB. I think that that is eighty,
117,726.69,729,10,This is nine RB so,,I don't know what what's,
118,729.84,731.91,10,Oh no they don't have any hints here,,,
119,732.78,736.71,10,,,Eighty gram sounds seems like a ninety gram to me but,
120,736.8,741.87,10,,Eighty let's let's go for eighty. Yeah,It's cool we have to I guess. Eighty alright,
121,741.93,757.62,10,I would have gone for one thirty,Eighty there you go. Yeah,I would go for ninety but you guys are going for eighty. Alright. Cool. Okay,For the final part of this test read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery
122,758.07,762.6,10,,What's this,,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
123,765.09,771.87,10,Can you read it out loud or something,Okay,Well the factory that creates the wooden blocks did not send us the second mystery block ,
124,771.96,781.47,10,,,You have two opportunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one two sentences how you determined your estimate. Indicate the weight of the second mystery block,
125,781.68,796.23,10,Fibonacci like let's say. That's the first one according to our translate. Thirteen one thirty,Eight. That's the first one. So eight plus five. Thirteen. Yeah there is one thirty. Eight plus five,Is that the first mystery block or the second mystery block,
126,796.59,800.01,10,,Just do it,Wait wait wait a second,
127,800.31,802.35,10,,Yeah,So that was the first mystery block,
128,802.44,810.78,10,,Yeah. The second one Means according to that statement is the second one. Mystery block two,and we already did that. Now this is. Yeah oh okay okay okay okay. Right,
129,810.87,813.03,10,,So eight plus five one thirty,,
130,813.84,820.08,10,Makes sense to me as much sense as I can make of it,Yeah. One thirty that's it,Okay,
131,820.41,823.38,10,,Follows Fibonacci series that's it,,
132,824.64,830.61,10,Follow Fibonacci. Please explain one,Yeah follows Fibonacci,Explain one,
133,830.91,834.45,10,,,,
134,836.04,838.89,10,,,mmm,
135,840.45,842.82,10,,,,
136,843.03,845.31,10,,,,
137,849.51,851.49,10,,,,
138,852.09,854.07,10,,,,
139,854.85,862.83,10,,And it works. And it works that's it,Second is one thirty right,
140,863.07,868.05,10,eighty plus fifty is,Yeah one one one thirty one thirty,Yeah it's one thirty it is I know that hang on a second one thirty,
141,868.71,871.92,10,Don't want to be incorrect in addition,,,
142,875.31,878.91,10,,,Okay,
143,881.04,889.65,10,,Yeah so we got it right. Do not for fall but please identify. Yay we completed it. Yeah,Okay. So yeah Fibonacci is what it is,
144,889.74,892.77,10,,Well they should ask this in GREs,,
145,892.89,895.2,10,,,,
