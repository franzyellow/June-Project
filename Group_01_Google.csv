Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4
0,3.45,7.14,1,Even length,,,I just need to calibrate my cameras real quick
1,9.87,12.45,1,,,,Alright so
2,12.63,15.75,1,,,,The task that you are doing today is called the weights task
3,16.2,21.36,1,,,,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of 5 cubes
4,22.17,24.27,1,,,,Um and then
5,24.42,27.72,1,,,,And we will tell you that this red cube on top is ten grams
6,28.74,31.32,1,Ok yeah  ,,,So uh
7,31.44,34.56,1,,,,You don't need to touch the slider on the scale don't worry about that part at all
8,35.01,36.99,1,,,,Oh
9,37.83,47.82,1,,,,So you have to place sorry please place the scales place the cubes on this worksheet where you prove that they weigh again yes
10,48.27,54.84,1,Oh and we don't touch the scale yet,,,And uh as you are filling it out if you guys can fill out the survey you will be group one
11,54.93,58.29,1,,,,Um you can touch the scale just like there's a slider
12,59.22,62.49,1,Ok so you want us to,,,But like you dont need to do anything with the slider
13,62.58,73.53,1,Use the scale to determine the weights ok cool where's the survey oh ok,,Um it's turned off,Yes um and if you guys can fill out that survey like as you go because you'll be submitting answers on there oh
14,75.81,84.3,1,Ok well it would be nine minus ten,Ok that's just ten so then  ,One,And you guys will be group one
15,86.07,89.04,1,Just like put it on,Does the slider move,,
16,90.12,92.13,1,Hold on lets just uh,,,
17,95.19,97.17,1,,,It seems pretty balanced,
18,97.56,102.03,1,Yeah ok so now we know that this is also ten,,,
19,102.39,105.87,1,Um ok so now,Ok,,
20,106.23,110.01,1,What would we maybe put that one on there too,Cool,,
21,110.16,114.24,1,And then see if there's thats twenty which is not,It's more,,
22,114.87,120.33,1,Lets try this one oh gee louise this one,,No,
23,121.2,125.01,1,Ok lets just oops sorry,,,
24,127.35,132,1,Ok so ten ten twenty,Ok so this one is probably twenty ten ten twenty,Yeah seems about twenty,
25,132.27,139.65,1,Ok so now lets start at thirty alright put one of those on there,Yeah thirty,Yes,
26,140.73,145.89,1,Ooh its looking like thirty,Probably thirty at this point,,
27,148.86,159.42,1,Ok so we got ok yeah this one is really heavy so lets do the a this and a ten,Yeah ten ten twenty thirty,Twenty thirty forty,
28,159.6,163.86,1,,,So fourty pounds,
29,164.37,171.99,1,Interesting so that's ten twenty,,Fifty pounds or pounds grams,
30,172.56,187.83,1,So we said this ones thirty I still feel like that's heavier and this one is twenty,Yeah yeah the blue dark blue one is thirty that's the larger one it's slightly heavier yeah,We can replace one of these with the twenty to get,
31,188.1,196.44,1,Ok and then put that on that one,,Sixty here,
32,198.15,202.14,1,Ten they're both,How much is the dark blue small one ten,,
33,203.49,206.37,1,Assuming that this was,Oh gosh I think I got them mixed up,,
34,207.06,210.87,1,Yeah Im thinking that it's ten ten twenty thirty,,,
35,211.29,213.93,1,So what have we done weve done forty,,,
36,214.47,216.45,1,Um,,,
37,216.63,219.06,1,And then we did fifty,It's just like slightly,,
38,219.33,221.49,1,And then we did sixty,,,
39,222.3,225.06,1,,,,
40,225.27,227.25,1,,,,
41,228.06,231.51,1,And now it stopped being too heavy,,,
42,231.54,233.52,1,So this is supposedly,,,
43,234.27,239.82,1,Thirty fourty fifty correct and it's still heavier than this thing,Fifty yeah,,
44,240.84,242.82,1,So have we done forty,,,
45,243.42,245.43,1,,,,
46,246.51,251.76,1,,,,
47,251.88,258.72,1,So thirty this is also forty right so this if forty ,Ok so that's one's twenty right,Yes,
48,260.01,263.82,1,This is fifty it's not ,,,
49,264.93,267.36,1,Yo that's close enough ok so,,,
50,267.57,272.58,1,Fifty boom,,Yeah fifty so we say yellow is fifty,
51,274.26,280.32,1,I think that's I think that's good,Yeah,And green is twenty ok so which one is blue and which one is purple,
52,281.25,286.26,1,,I think this one is purple and this one is blue,Ok so blue is ten and purple is,
53,286.56,292.47,1,Yes verify real quick but I think it is,Yes thirty,Thirty,
54,295.32,304.62,1,Yeah we got them,Yeah,Yes do you want to check real quick,
55,304.68,307.2,1,That looks good to me,,Ok  ,
56,308.28,312.3,1,Uh blue yeah so you said purple,,,
57,312.93,318.69,1,You're right,Purple is thirty red is twenty yellow is fifty,Cool,
58,318.72,321.81,1,Ok we have finished and we were correct,,,
59,321.84,323.97,1,,,,Ok awesome um
60,324.12,339.63,1,Ok definitely minimum fifty,Minimum fifty,Oh,You are now going to determine the weight of this block without the scale you will have two attempts to get the weight correctly
61,339.87,341.85,1,,,,And you can now continue
62,342.06,347.07,1,Yeah because if you feel the yellow one,,Do we get a glass of water,
63,347.1,349.08,1,,,,
64,350.73,352.71,1,Yeah,Definitely heavier,Yeah,
65,354.36,359.76,1,Ok so we got this ok,,,
66,361.23,365.07,1,Ooh that seems pretty good pretty close to me,,,
67,365.49,367.98,1,,How much was purple thirty,,
68,368.7,370.68,1,,Purple was thirty,Yeah,
69,370.86,372.84,1,,And yellow was fifty,,
70,373.89,380.58,1,Yeah try picking these two up and you can close your eyes and try to hold it from the,,Which would put eighty,
71,381.48,383.61,1,Yeah same point maybe,,,
72,383.7,388.41,1,I don't know its hard,,I almost feel like this one is still heavier,
73,388.44,390.51,1,,,,
74,394.62,399.66,1,,This one feels heavier still add like ten to this side I think,,
75,402.81,406.89,1,,It still feels heavier but it could just be,,
76,407.58,410.37,1,,,It is definitely denser which could be skewing,
77,410.52,412.5,1,,,Our perception of it,
78,413.43,415.83,1,Oh jeez yeah,So right now that's ninety grams,,
79,416.76,420.03,1,And na that's freaking that's way,,,
80,420.96,423.39,1,,That's a hundred,,
81,423.87,430.47,1,Yeah that feels pretty pretty similar to me and try switching it left hand right hand maybe,,,
82,432.66,435.72,1,,That does feel pretty similar give it a shot,,
83,437.46,439.44,1,,,,
84,440.4,442.53,1,,,Yeah I think its,
85,442.68,454.47,1,Yeah that's a good first guess and we get two so do you think we should a consensus on that one and this is fifty,Let's do it yeah a hundred I think,It feels really similar and that's a hundred grams,
86,455.37,459.27,1,Thirty twenty,Thirty twenty right ok yeah,,
87,460.26,464.28,1,Uh yeah so should we press the blue arrow,,,
88,464.64,473.25,1,The current weight of the last that was our first test ok,,We're on this screen right now should we go onto the next one,
89,473.37,479.88,1,Ok a hundred ok,,Two attempts a hundred will it tell us if we get it right or wrong ok,
90,481.71,485.94,1,That was not quite correct ok,,,
91,487.11,489.69,1,,I think you're thinking more,I think it's more if it's anything,
92,491.07,495.42,1,,Is that less right now oh,That's less right now,
93,495.72,502.83,1,Oh yeah that is where we were at,We were at this yet ok,No that's a hundred and ten,
94,504.9,511.29,1,The thing that sucks is that now we are finding about like torque and different other,Ooh,,
95,511.32,514.47,1,Perceptions of uh,,,
96,517.02,519.24,1,,I still think the brown one is heavier than this,,
97,520.98,522.96,1,,,,
98,523.89,527.58,1,,It's hard to balance them,Yeah,
99,528.27,530.25,1,,,,
100,533.01,537.3,1,I wonder like I don't know what that one,,,
101,538.17,541.44,1,God yeah balances is hard,Yeah,,
102,541.74,545.94,1,So I think definitely it's either,,,
103,546.21,554.52,1,It's this or this because we can't even make these weights so it could be above them I know but like if we are thinking it's so close to a hundred,,That could be part of it,
104,555.57,561.69,1,Are probably errors within twenty,,Twenty  ,
105,562.08,565.26,1,So would you,No that doesn't do anything,,
106,565.59,574.71,1,,I would say either a hundred twenty or a hundred thirty because I feel like it would be possible for it to be out of range of what we can measure but,,
107,574.92,576.9,1,Yeah,,,
108,578.88,582.09,1,Yeah it's just weird,,,
109,589.86,602.07,1,I don't know I guess I would vote one of these two but what do you guys think,Between the two I would say a hundred twenty,,
110,603.9,608.64,1,,,It feels close I just can't tell if like,
111,609,612.75,1,,So right now this is one-twenty,One twenty,
112,618.81,623.4,1,Do you want to try one twenty then,,,
113,623.43,628.02,1,,Yeah it's either one twenty or one thirty for me so I think one twenty would be the best guess,,
114,630.57,641.28,1,Eighty grams wow,,What hey hey we were right about our margin of error of twenty we were just thinking in the wrong direction,
115,641.79,652.35,1,Yeah it's gotta be something to do with the verticality of this but yeah we  failed,,,
116,652.65,655.02,1,,,,For the final part of the task
117,655.17,666.21,1,,,,Read the scenario that will come up for the next part of the survey and estimate the weight of the next block and you will again have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer
118,666.24,669,1,,,,And you can now continue the survey
119,677.16,679.14,1,They didn't send us the next block,,,
120,679.23,686.61,1,So we ok,,,
121,686.94,692.37,1,Two oppurtunites to estimate the weight of the second block explain one,,It's the fibonacci series,
122,694.98,697.29,1,That's twenty ok um,,,
123,697.32,701.34,1,Explain in one to two sentence what I determined,,,
124,702.21,707.07,1,Ok yeah so we got one one two,,Yeah it's the fibonacci series,
125,707.37,712.26,1,Three three plus two is five five plus two,,,
126,712.62,723.9,1,Wow wait so one thirty ok,Eight eight plus five is one hundred thirty,Yeah,
127,724.11,729.42,1,F I B B or,,Um I have no idea how to spell Fibonacci,
128,729.69,731.79,1,It's F I B O,,,
129,732.75,739.02,1,And then N N or N A C C I yeah I need to resee it ,N A C C I I think so yeah,Yeah,
130,739.53,741.51,1,Yeah,,,
131,743.28,745.62,1,Pattern was recognized I guess,,,
132,748.38,753.45,1,,Can't be like three other patterns that people can do,,
133,754.77,757.89,1,Um yeah let's I think that's fine,,,
134,760.41,771.36,1,It was wow ok we we got that one correct because of mister power work ,Yeah that was a good thought,,
135,771.6,774.39,1,,Yeah no I wouldn't have thought of that,,
136,780.15,783.54,1,That's why you need three minds,,Yeah,
137,783.9,785.88,1,,,,
138,785.97,787.8,1,Eighty grams  ,Yeah I was thinking,,
