Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4
0,11.82,27.57,3,,,,Ok so the test that you are going to be completing today oh I can take those consent forms sorry thank you the test you are going to be completing today is the weights test
1,28.2,32.67,3,,,,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these blocks
2,33.39,38.04,3,,,,We will tell you that the weight of the red cube is ten grams
3,38.76,42.57,3,,,,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using this scale
4,43.68,46.5,3,,,,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams
5,46.86,50.43,3,,,,You don't need to use the slider or anything 
6,51,58.38,3,,,,And the weights aren't always perfect so if it's teetering it's probably fine
7,58.44,60.57,3,,,,Like it it drops one's probably heavier
8,61.35,64.23,3,,,,Um and then
9,64.26,75.69,3,,,,You will place the cubes on the worksheet where you think they are and you will also record your answers here on this survey here on the computer. You guys will be group three
10,77.91,80.37,3,,,,And you can now start the survey
11,80.55,86.25,3,Alright so shall we,,,
12,86.43,89.4,3,Prepare things for this one,,Yeah,
13,90.33,92.46,3,,,,
14,95.52,99.06,3,,,,
15,101.37,103.74,3,,,,
16,112.41,114.39,3,So you think they're the same wait or,,,
17,116.13,118.17,3,They're still teetering,,,
18,119.37,121.53,3,,,,
19,129.21,134.16,3,,,,
20,135.15,137.13,3,,,,
21,138.33,140.46,3,,,,
22,142.38,147.27,3,I think they're the same weight yeah so,I think they're the same weight,,
23,148.62,152.4,3,So the  ,,So  ,
24,152.43,155.22,3,,,Um  ,
25,155.67,157.95,3,,,,
26,159.15,162,3,So,,So,
27,162.45,165.36,3,,,The blue one is also ten right,
28,165.45,167.82,3,Right,,So I should indicate it as ten,
29,168.99,171.72,3,Um I'm going to see if there's a lighter one,,,
30,179.07,181.11,3,,,,
31,183.78,185.76,3,,,,
32,186.96,192.42,3,The suspense is killing me it takes forever,,,
33,207.42,209.4,3,,,,
34,212.13,219.93,3,Sufficient to say that one's probably twenty or,,Yes it's probably twenty so green one is twenty,
35,219.96,226.53,3,What do you want,Then well  I want to check if N A block is thirty,,
36,227.61,229.92,3,,,,
37,232.32,235.65,3,I think that's a good guess,,,
38,236.34,238.32,3,,So,,
39,238.47,240.45,3,,The purple one is thirty,,
40,241.8,246,3,,Which one is the one which is purple,Purple is thirty yeah,
41,246.36,250.86,3,I think this is more purple-y,Hold that purple,This is blue maybe,
42,251.49,253.47,3,Um,,,
43,254.04,264.18,3,This one feels just a smidge heavier yeah try that one,,,
44,264.21,268.29,3,,Green and this one,Green is twenty right,
45,268.35,272.58,3,,,Green is twenty and purple is thirty so it weighs to fifty,
46,274.95,277.05,3,It seems to be,,,
47,277.53,281.43,3,It's leaning more to the side,Yeah I mentioned here green is twenty,,
48,285.18,287.82,3,,It's leaning more to the side,,
49,288.93,294.3,3,,,So how about yellow,
50,295.29,300.96,3,,Then green is twenty and they weigh,Uh put both on top please,
51,302.91,305.34,3,,,Yeah just to confirm,
52,305.46,310.8,3,Wait purple is how much,,Purple is thirty,
53,314.1,317.43,3,And green is ,,Yellow is not ten,
54,318.6,320.58,3,Twenty,,,
55,322.83,324.81,3,,,,
56,326.85,330.69,3,Have we tried these two and the green one cause it's,,,
57,331.05,333.57,3,Kinda dipping,,,
58,333.69,335.82,3,,,,
59,336.06,341.55,3,Nope that's too light ok too light,,No so when we try these both,
60,344.01,348.36,3,That is equivalent to the,,So I feel the low is fifty,
61,348.96,352.41,3,,,,
62,356.19,359.46,3,,,This has thirty and twenty,
63,359.91,362.94,3,,,Yeah green is twenty and purple is thirty,
64,366.06,371.16,3,,It's for sure not thirty,,
65,371.49,378.24,3,So if you put the purple just to verify all of our weights are correct,,,
66,378.27,380.25,3,Uh,,,
67,396.69,404.73,3,It must be this right because comparing it to forty it's,Fifty,Fifty yeah,
68,405.48,407.64,3,Not that heavy,,,
69,408.93,411.03,3,So are we done,,,
70,413.94,415.92,3,Try it,,,
71,416.34,418.5,3,,,,
72,418.92,422.85,3,,,,
73,423.09,426.93,3,,,,
74,427.92,430.44,3,,,Twenty green yeah,
75,431.58,435.75,3,,Thirty and yellow is fifty,Thirty and this is fifty,
76,435.78,440.73,3,,Maybe we should try those things here,,
77,444.78,447.87,3,Try what then,,Just place the color on top,
78,450.33,453.93,3,,Yes,,And have you guys filled out the survey
79,459.84,466.8,3,,,Uh just till fifty so should I sumbit it,Um did you submit the answer
80,469.65,473.16,3,,,Correct red is ten blue is ten,
81,473.7,489.87,3,Oh fun,,Green is twenty purple is thirty and yellow is fifty yeah good,Ok  so for the next part if the test you are going to determine the weight of this block without using the scale to get the answer
82,490.23,492.21,3,,,,And you can begin now
83,497.58,500.34,3,Think it's a little heavier than the yellow,,,
84,501.12,503.1,3,,,,
85,505.05,507.09,3,,,,
86,507.54,509.85,3,,,,
87,510.21,512.28,3,,,,
88,518.79,522.48,3,Is there a way for us to test it other than just our,,,
89,522.84,524.82,3,Perception,,,
90,532.53,536.73,3,,,I think this is a bit more heavier,
91,537.54,539.52,3,,,So,
92,541.83,547.11,3,,,Maybe ninety or a hundred,
93,548.37,558.03,3,I bet there's a scale app on our phone and I bet it's cheating to download that,,,It's cheating
94,558.69,560.67,3,,,,
95,567.39,569.61,3,,Yeah it could be eighty ninety,,
96,569.88,574.89,3,,Eighty to ninety,I think it is between ninety to a hundred,
97,576.3,581.25,3,,,Because yeah green is twenty thirty and fifty right so,
98,581.31,583.86,3,,,Maybe a hundred or so,
99,584.76,586.74,3,,,,
100,587.04,590.67,3,Is it twice as heavy as the yellow one I can't tell,No it's not,,
101,591.45,596.94,3,Are the wait which one was the fifty one it was the ,,Fifty is yellow yeah,
102,599.13,601.83,3,,It's not twice as heavy as yellow,,
103,609.12,612.06,3,,I think it's between eighty and ninety,,
104,612.33,614.4,3,,,,
105,616.05,621,3,I have a question ok somebody like hold the yellow and the brown,,,
106,621.09,631.11,3,and your eyes and just kind of like hold them really flat and close your eyes for a second and tell me when the yellow tell me when this hand feels the same as the other,,,
107,632.55,634.83,3,,,This is heavier,
108,635.58,638.4,3,But like tell me when it starts to feel the same,,,
109,643.17,648.78,3,Still lighter,,I think yeah it does,
110,648.96,654,3,I was trying to take the visual input out of it,,I think it is ok now,
111,654.18,656.16,3,You think that's about the same,,Yeah,
112,657.24,664.5,3,Yeah yeah try it try it again,,Yeah I feel that can you try that,
113,669.27,671.25,3,,,How do you feel this one is lighter,
114,674.82,677.82,3,I feel like this one might be a smidge heavier,,,
115,678.12,683.79,3,Like the right my right I feel like that one could be a smidge heavier but,,,
116,683.94,685.92,3,I don't know hang on,,,
117,689.1,691.08,3,,,I'll just check now,
118,692.01,693.99,3,Now I feel like the right side,,,
119,694.62,696.6,3,Definitely heavier right,,,
120,697.47,708.48,3,It's hard to tell it's hard to tell they're really close they're really close yeah give it a shot ok so here's our heavy one,,It's it's your turn you have to try now you have to try,
121,708.99,710.97,3,,Ok,,
122,713.04,720.99,3,,I think this is heavier now,Oh my god,
123,721.26,726.18,3,,Does heavier objects roll down the incline plane faster,,
124,727.29,730.17,3,,It's the same,,
125,731.37,734.1,3,,,But where do we get that now,
126,734.13,737.67,3,,,,
127,737.88,742.59,3,I think we would have to have really good measures yeah yeah,,Does this really heavier than this for sure,
128,743.58,745.77,3,,,,
129,749.43,751.41,3,,,,
130,755.07,757.98,3,,,Can get that one,
131,758.43,760.89,3,,,,
132,769.05,777.81,3,I feel like there's gotta be a clever way like an answer I don't know what it is,,Ok I think it would be ninety or something,
133,779.52,781.5,3,,,,
134,784.86,786.84,3,,,,
135,786.87,790.86,3,,Now I think it might be hundred but,,
136,791.37,801.9,3,,Maybe ninety to,Yeah in between ninety and hundred but when we see normally when we compare those both but it is not showing that it is exactly double or something,
137,802.41,805.44,3,Can I see your phone actually,Yeah it's not double,,
138,809.31,813.42,3,,,Wow,
139,813.51,824.16,3,,I think we had place on our block here so it won't fall directly,Oops put both at a time maybe,
140,825.63,827.61,3,,,,
141,828.33,830.31,3,,,I'll remember that red one,
142,831.78,840.21,3,I feel like that's close enough that's close enough right,,It's yeah that's really a bit tiny yeah,
143,840.24,849.39,3,,,Just once remove this block,
144,849.9,854.52,3,,Seventy it's just seventy,Purple is thirty even we are getting that,
145,854.73,857.82,3,,,,
146,858.03,861.99,3,,,Oops,
147,862.2,864.63,3,We just got it balanced too well I think,,,
148,868.83,870.81,3,,,,
149,872.37,875.07,3,,,,
150,877.14,879.12,3,,,,
151,880.71,882.69,3,,,,
152,882.9,886.74,3,Yeah it's pretty far to this side right now,,,
153,887.49,892.92,3,Fourth try,,We'll do one thing,
154,894.51,899.1,3,,,,
155,899.19,901.35,3,Oh yeah,,,
156,905.97,908.19,3,,,,
157,909.54,911.58,3,,,,
158,914.7,919.11,3,It's leaning that side,,Yeah it's leaning that way ok,
159,919.56,921.6,3,,,,
160,921.63,923.91,3,,It's eighty,,
161,924.9,926.88,3,,,,
162,927.15,932.73,3,,,It's leaning still leaning that side just remove one,
163,934.02,939.54,3,What ok so this one's fifty and thirty,,Fifty and thirty,
164,940.17,943.35,3,,If you have like if you keep twenty,,
165,945.12,949.77,3,,It should it does still leaning,,
166,952.8,954.84,3,,,,
167,961.32,965.31,3,,,I'm thinking to just remove this once,
168,965.79,971.49,3,,So it's ninety,So now it's leaning this way if we put that it's leaning this way ninety,
169,971.7,973.68,3,What if,,Maybe,
170,973.71,978.78,3,Yeah I was going to say stick that here let's uh try this,,Ok let me  ,
171,979.47,984.06,3,,,,
172,984.33,987.03,3,,,,
173,987.42,989.4,3,,,,
174,990.84,996.09,3,So then theory do we have these positioned the same,,,
175,996.12,998.37,3,In theory we think this should be,,,
176,999.06,1001.04,3,Yes  ,,,
177,1006.23,1010.25,3,We're close either way we're close,,Yeah,
178,1011.27,1013.88,3,,,It's definitely not hundred so,
179,1014.81,1020.42,3,I think that's  ,It's nintey see even for that its,,
180,1021.11,1023.93,3,,It's same see uh,,
181,1024.62,1026.6,3,,Here it started to ,,
182,1026.75,1034.73,3,If only our block was a little just narrow sliver,What if you removed the ten,,
183,1034.85,1036.83,3,,,,
184,1038.24,1041.75,3,,I think it's eighty now,,
185,1042.05,1044.12,3,Yeah,,Yeah but when it but ,
186,1046.28,1051.32,3,,,It's even the same it's this annoying climate ok let me try put in this,
187,1052.28,1054.35,3,,,Oops,
188,1054.65,1064.31,3,Let's try it with a different let's try it with that phone for a second and see just to rule out like maybe this phone design is heavier on one side right,,It's the same ok,
189,1064.4,1066.56,3,,,Is it ok,
190,1067.82,1070.1,3,,,,
191,1071.57,1080.81,3,It's I think I think this one's this block is just too flat,,It's I think I think this one's this block is just too flat,
192,1081.32,1083.3,3,,,,
193,1083.99,1086.33,3,Just to test like,,,
194,1086.75,1089.72,3,Yeah I think it's,,,
195,1090.32,1095.54,3,They're just too sturdy and flat it's hard to tell,,,
196,1095.84,1098.9,3,We can definitely rule things out but I think uh,,,
197,1099.74,1102.17,3,Too crude of a measurement to,,,
198,1102.44,1105.44,3,Narrow down that like ten gram window,,,
199,1105.8,1109.52,3,,,,
200,1110.48,1113.69,3,Do we want to say eighty,,,
201,1113.78,1117.35,3,,,I'm confused between eighty and ninety,
202,1122.09,1124.07,3,,,,
203,1127.01,1135.47,3,Yeah it's too balanced,,,
204,1136.01,1140.99,3,Like have another object,,,
205,1142.61,1145.64,3,Are we allowed to use,,Uh there's a scale,
206,1146,1161.36,3,Well we're not even allowed to use the scale I say we give it our best guess at this point,,So what should I answer this,
207,1163.55,1165.77,3,,,,
208,1166.85,1168.83,3,,,,
209,1173.27,1175.64,3,,,We have two attempts to do this,
210,1175.85,1188.87,3,Ok we have two attempts oh well then let's maybe we just try eighty and see if that's right and if it's not then it rules out,,Yeah we have two attempts eighty eighty is good for three ninety yeah I'm just clicking on eighty,
211,1191.3,1198.41,3,Oh we got it it's right eighty yeah,,Oh it's right eighty,
212,1198.5,1201.29,3,,,,Ok for the final part of the task
213,1201.44,1206.6,3,,,,Read the scenario in the next slide and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block
214,1206.99,1217.76,3,,,Uh the factory that creates wooden blocks did not send us a second mystery block,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
215,1218.33,1220.31,3,,,Weights so the second block,
216,1224.81,1236,3,Ok so we literally know nothing about the second block this sounds like a Bayesian probability question right,,The second yes yeah so we have to use only this,
217,1237.44,1247.04,3,Well I assume we can use the second the first mystery block as a data point,,The first mystery block this is eighty we could just ,
218,1247.22,1250.88,3,Yeah,Uh I how,,
219,1251.12,1254.33,3,,Like they have two one forty grams,,
220,1254.51,1268.76,3,Every possible weight up to one forty you think so we got ,So it must be a set so we should be able to make every possible weight here with these blocks they have one fifty two,,
221,1268.82,1271.1,3,,Maybe,,
222,1272.27,1282.02,3,,Maybe we must be able to do every weight here,Yeah the highest we can make is a one fifty we can make a one fifty even,
223,1282.86,1291.65,3,So with all of these we can make it up to one fifty,And we can make it up to one fifty so if we find a block,,
224,1293.03,1298.01,3,Ok yeah eighty plus fifty fifty and then yeah ok,,,
225,1298.55,1308.63,3,,We have ten two tens we have twenty we have thirty we can make forty with these three we can we have fifty,,
226,1309.08,1314.06,3,,We have fifty with sixty sixty these two seventy,Sixty and these two,
227,1314.21,1322.07,3,,We have eighty we can make ninety we can make,We can make ninety a hundred even one ten even,
228,1322.73,1325.94,3,,One ten ok one twenty,,
229,1326.75,1334.28,3,,Yeah this is four ok one twenty is done,Yeah we can it's thirty and ten,
230,1334.55,1341.96,3,,And uh one thirty yeah fifty ok,And one thirty is automatically fifty plus eighty,
231,1342.17,1348.38,3,,And then ok,One forty obviously we can make that and one fifty,
232,1348.5,1353.42,3,So we want to guess one fifty is that,,And yeah we can make everything,
233,1356.03,1358.01,3,,,,
234,1358.22,1363.05,3,,,We have two oppurtunities for that even so,
235,1363.11,1374.9,3,,,Whatever like how did we guess eighty like we used only two blocks even for measurement of everything we just used two blocks so I'm thinking,
236,1375.02,1377.81,3,,,If we just used only two blocks then,
237,1377.93,1380.87,3,,,The highest two blocks may weigh something,
238,1381.35,1388.85,3,And that would be one thirty right,,One thirty yeah because we measured this with the help of,
239,1388.94,1390.92,3,,,These two,
240,1392.09,1397.94,3,Wait wait wait,,And with this we measured with these two and with this we measured with the help of these two,
241,1399.11,1401.36,3,The instructions,,We almost,
