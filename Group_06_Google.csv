Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4
0,3.09,6.9,6,,,,I need to callibrate my cameras and then we can get started
1,11.19,14.61,6,,,,The task that you will be completing today is called the weights task
2,15.03,20.61,6,,,,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of these colorful cubes here
3,21.12,24.51,6,,,,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
4,25.44,30.93,6,,,,All of the weights are in intervals of ten so you don't need to use the slider at all
5,31.35,38.25,6,,,,Um the scale like is a little bit finnicky but like as long as it doesn't drop down it's probably good like you can see right now it's
6,39.75,47.55,6,,,,Um so as you work through the tasks if you can place the cubes on the sheet where they go and also fill out the survey
7,47.82,50.79,6,,,,Um that is on this computer
8,51,57.09,6,,,,With the answers and you guys are going to be group number six and you can now start the survey
9,61.23,66,6,I guess if this red one's ten grams,We got red ten,,
10,66.36,68.34,6,,,,
11,72.45,76.17,6,Seems like it might be about the same,,,
12,80.52,85.29,6,,,I would agree so this one's ten,
13,85.47,89.7,6,,,Alright let's see if we can find a twenty,
14,89.76,93.15,6,,Way too heavy,Too heavy so,
15,93.36,96.63,6,,,,
16,97.44,99.78,6,,This is a sensitive scale,,
17,102.3,104.28,6,That's looking pretty even,Looks like about twenty,,
18,104.76,109.2,6,,,Alright let's see if we can find a thirty,
19,109.44,113.19,6,So this one is noticeably heavier than,Probably that big sucker,,
20,113.94,115.95,6,The purple ish one,,,
21,116.79,125.37,6,Making sure that it didn't have the weight at the bottom,It's just different at the bottom that's a so that's a ten and a twenty right now right that's looking,,
22,125.49,127.47,6,,Well,,
23,127.62,131.76,6,Yeah I think,Their increments of ten I would say that's probably,,
24,131.79,135.96,6,Yeah it looks a little,Cause that's also a twenty let's double check that that's not also a twenty,,
25,136.44,141.09,6,,Cause it um just that one there,Is this one a twenty,
26,141.18,146.85,6,,Ok so it's more than twenty but it almost seems like the thirty takes it past but,,
27,148.2,150.18,6,,It's so sensitive,,
28,154.32,162.57,6,I think yeah it has to be thirty it,If they're only in increments of ten it has to be,I think it could also be the position,
29,162.84,171.21,6,So I would guess the yellow one is gonna be,So big blue is probably thirty,Of the weight,
30,172.35,174.33,6,Forty,,,
31,175.11,177.48,6,,,,
32,177.57,179.55,6,,Fifty,Fifty,
33,180.33,182.31,6,Oh maybe not,,,
34,186.24,190.92,6,,,Yeah that's considerably heavier so this one did we say this was thirty,
35,191.01,195.21,6,,Yeah that's thirty green is twenty,And this was ten,
36,195.24,199.41,6,,Red and small blue are both ten,It's definitely not thirty so it has to,
37,201.21,203.97,6,,,But it's too heavy,
38,205.44,211.5,6,This is fifty on here so then,Yeah green and big blue,Yeah fifty,
39,211.56,222.66,6,Big blue,Unless she's messing with us and some of these are in increments of five,Did we try forty we did try forty because this one's thirty and then this one's or this one's twenty,
40,223.5,226.56,6,Bib blue was forty,So that should be forty right there,,
41,237.36,243.39,6,I would say that it is at least closest to fifty,I would say yellow is like forty five but we could say fifty since we're,,
42,243.57,246.33,6,,Forced with these,,
43,246.39,248.73,6,Alright,,,
44,249.6,251.94,6,,,,
45,253.86,255.84,6,,Sweet,,
46,256.35,264.54,6,,Ok nice,I think we're done,Have you filled it out on the computer you guys are group six
47,264.99,267.66,6,,,,
48,268.74,271.38,6,Yellow is fifty,,,
49,273.39,279.48,6,,Green's twenty big blue's thirty,Yeah I guess that one's,
50,280.11,286.44,6,,Oh that's purple you're right,I think that one's purple so blue was ten and purple was thirty,
51,286.5,288.48,6,,Yes,,
52,288.87,290.85,6,,,,
53,291.99,299.55,6,,We got it right good job team,So red was ten yellow was fifty we're great,
54,299.58,303.72,6,,,,
55,304.38,308.52,6,,,,You need to now determine the weight of this mystery block
56,308.82,314.61,6,,,,Without using the scale you will have two attempts to enter it correctly onto this survey and you can now begin
57,314.94,318.27,6,,Fun oh boy,Alright guys,
58,318.33,320.7,6,,,Is it heavy,
59,321.27,324.69,6,,We should each do it separate and see what we think,,
60,324.75,327.51,6,,Yeah exactly,Just don't say it until you,
61,329.28,331.56,6,,,,
62,331.65,336.15,6,,,Oh I guess we can see it,
63,339.33,343.65,6,,Ok  ,,
64,348.12,350.79,6,,,,
65,353.88,355.86,6,,,,
66,358.83,360.81,6,,,,
67,368.76,374.55,6,,We can't use the scale but what else do we have that can be,,
68,375.48,377.46,6,,,,
69,377.79,383.46,6,I don't think she intends for us,Are we allowed to make our own scales is there rules,,
70,385.26,388.8,6,,Or are you not allowed to tell us what we are allowed to do,,
71,389.01,390.99,6,,,,You guys are just problem solving
72,394.59,399.72,6,,That's about as even as I can get it unless somebody can,I like your idea,
73,399.75,402.75,6,,We're getting close,,
74,402.9,405.18,6,,,,
75,406.41,412.14,6,,But let's let him do hands and then we'll we'll play with that but I'm thinking,,
76,412.65,414.66,6,,More right yeah,,
77,416.22,419.4,6,,Yeah maybe one of these,I'm interested in this,
78,419.94,422.1,6,,,,
79,422.19,424.8,6,,,Oh that's a heavy one,
80,424.95,427.35,6,,Yeah,,
81,427.47,429.9,6,,,Ok,
82,432.21,437.07,6,,Yeah so if you held if you hold them all in one and like yeah,Which ones twenty this one,
83,437.4,439.38,6,,Um yeah,,
84,443.31,447.78,6,,So now you've got forty on there now you've got,,
85,449.16,451.89,6,,,,
86,452.79,463.65,6,Let's see how callibrated this is,Yeah oh yeah yeah put your ten and your ten let's callibrate our little scale,,
87,465.93,470.85,6,It leans slowly that way,So even when they're equal it leans,,
88,472.38,474.9,6,Let's try the thirty and then,,,
89,474.99,483.6,6,Purple and then let's put green and a ten,,Alright alright lemme just lemme just give it a go here,
90,483.72,488.91,6,,One twenty total,Alright so how much do we have here one twenty total,
91,488.94,498.63,6,,That felt to me like it was heavier than all of those,So it's gotta be like a like heavier so it's over one twenty we know that so it's over one twenty,
92,498.84,504.3,6,,I would agree with that,I think we can all agree on that how heavier how heavy would you say,
93,504.51,508.32,6,,,We've only got two choices above oh we have three choices above,
94,509.22,517.68,6,Well and it could be past the end of sheet if they're trying to be tricky,Yeah she gives us up to one fifty on our survey,,
95,518.46,529.86,6,Let me see um yes I can,Who can think of any other oh is there a liquid in there let's do some density stuff let's see drop the blocks into his coffee see how much it goes up,,
96,530.22,534.84,6,Drink enough coffee until it weighs the weight is,What's the what's the,How much is the yellow one again,
97,534.93,537.18,6,,That one was fifty,Fifty,
98,537.45,539.94,6,,,Alright so I would say I would say,
99,540.57,545.07,6,,,We have one twenty we got at least forty so I would say one sixty,
100,545.19,548.16,6,,Yeah,So one fifty is the highest yeah,
101,548.22,553.77,6,,I'm I'm good with it it's real heavy,Here if anybody wants to yeah it's heavy,
102,554.37,556.41,6,,,,
103,556.95,560.34,6,,Yeah,These are the only I would go higher than one fifty,
104,560.49,564.03,6,See if some of these blocks weigh similar to my coffee,That's definitely our only options,,
105,566.55,568.77,6,,,Do you know how much the coffee weighs though,
106,569.13,577.86,6,I wonder if we can guess it's similar in weight to these three,If he just said it off the bat I would be like wow,Alright,
107,578.37,589.08,6,So we can use that as an estimate or we can but we know how much these three weigh and if its about the same as the coffee,,Yeah we don't know how much the coffee weighs though true,
108,589.83,594.36,6,,Oh then we can start adding more is what he's saying ok got it,Then yeah the coffee oh ok,
109,594.66,601.74,6,,And these three would be yellow purple and blue which would be a hundred right no ninety,,
110,602.49,605.4,6,Feel it and make sure it's,,,
111,606.21,608.19,6,Roughly the same,,,
112,608.52,611.46,6,,,,
113,611.88,615.87,6,,Sure this might even be a tad tad heavier but,,
114,616.53,618.51,6,,,,
115,620.4,623.22,6,,Sorry,,
116,624.84,630.72,6,,I mean that does seem like we're getting closer interesting,So what do you have there two hundred,
117,631.65,639.24,6,,Yeah ninety plus ninety so one eighty yeah I think the heaviest option and if it's wrong go one forty,One eighty yeah,
118,639.75,642.99,6,,And we get two tries,,
119,644.25,646.23,6,,Here's a hint,,
120,648.42,650.76,6,Oh   ,,Ah think of a pattern,
121,652.14,654.12,6,Ten ten,,,
122,655.41,657.39,6,Twenty,,,
123,658.35,663.57,6,Thirty oh it's the sum of the previous two wait,,,
124,664.14,668.58,6,Ten and ten make twenty ten and twenty make thirty twenty thirty fifty,,,
125,669.24,671.22,6,,Fifty thirty eighty,,
126,672,679.5,6,,There's no way that's eighty it feels way heavier but the pattern sticks,,
127,680.94,684.24,6,,,I like that idea,
128,684.75,693.21,6,,Yeah I guess now that my I mean,Cause it's definitely not one fifty anyways so we might as well just,
129,696.24,702.6,6,I I feel like it it I think it feels heaiver but,,What do you guys think,
130,705.18,712.56,6,It's the fibonacci sequence,Why can't I think of what this pattern is right now the name for this pattern fib yeah so are we we're doing fib,What do you no so like here here's the first one yeah,
131,712.77,715.23,6,,So then that would be there,,
132,715.95,725.01,6,,It's a good I mean it's the best we got I'm I'm ok with it I stand I stand to lose nothing here,Are you guys good with eighty,
133,725.16,729.87,6,,We got it so given the hint,Eighty grams we're geniuses,
134,730.62,734.04,6,,Our system felt like way heavier to me,It's way heavier than eighty,
135,734.13,746.34,6,We're done with this part,Yeah I want to see these on a scale full of,Yeah I think that's an idication of the alright can we get the scale back real quIck,For the final part of the task read the scenario survey and estimate the weight of the 
136,746.4,758.4,6,,Yeah I mean we feel like we're there already so fifty plus eighty is one thirty,,Of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey
137,758.91,761.46,6,,So I'd say a missing would be one thirty,,
138,761.67,764.28,6,,And I would say the explanation is fib,,
139,764.46,766.44,6,,,,
140,768.42,772.53,6,,Yep yep,Alright so one thirty then,
141,776.16,784.08,6,I've got it,Cool,One or two sentences who wants to be a literary,
142,784.68,786.66,6,,Given the clue,,
143,786.81,792.27,6,,Yeah I wouldn't have picked that up that's fun,,
144,795.12,798.3,6,,,,
145,799.62,801.6,6,,,,
146,805.11,808.47,6,,,,
147,810.18,812.19,6,,,,
148,812.43,815.4,6,,eighty plus fifty plus,,
149,815.82,817.8,6,,,,
150,820.8,822.96,6,,,,
151,823.77,826.11,6,Did it,We're done,,
152,827.97,829.95,6,,,,
