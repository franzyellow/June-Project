3,14.82,18.18,2,,,,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task,4,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task
4,18.75,23.1,2,,,,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of these five cubes,4,In the first part you are going to work together to determine the weight of these five cubes
5,23.52,32.73,2,,Can we use this piece of paper,,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams,4,And we can tell you that that red cube right there is ten grams
6,33.3,36.42,2,,,,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them,4,You are going to determine the rest of the weights using them
7,36.45,38.76,2,,,,Using the scale um,4,Using the scale um
8,39.48,45.21,2,,,,And you don't need to use the slider on the scale just like round up to whatever like zero so you don't have to worry about like 23,4,And you don't need to use the slider on the scale just like round up to whatever like zero so you don't have to worry about like 23
9,46.83,54.78,2,,,,Um and then go ahead and place the scale on the worksheet when you've gotten the weight and also enter it into this survey,4,Um and then go ahead and place the scale on the worksheet when you've gotten the weight and also enter it into this survey
10,54.9,57.3,2,,,,You guys are going to be group two,4,You guys are going to be group two
11,57.63,68.01,2,Ok cool no for sure,Alright you guys mind if I just start some tests,,And you can go ahead and start,4,And you can go ahead and start

16,86.82,88.95,2,So I would imagine if this,,,,1,So I would imagine if this
17,88.98,94.65,2,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal,And I I think they are,,,1,Needle goes over the red line that means they're probably equal
18,94.77,97.05,2,,Especially since it keeps going back,,,2,Especially since it keeps going back
19,97.11,102.39,2,Yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know,Even length,,,1,Yeah they also just look like relatively the same size but they could be different material you know
20,102.45,106.23,2,So that one is probably ten grams too,Yeah,,,1,So that one is probably ten grams too
21,108.06,111.3,2,And then if that's ten grams then we have a two,,,,1,And then if that's ten grams then we have a two
22,112.29,117.87,2,Yeah,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest,,,2,So I'm going to hold back on that one because I think it's the heaviest
23,119.13,121.59,2,We can do like the green one,The green one,,,1,We can do like the green one

104,561.12,566.28,2,So plus or minus ten right,One more attempt alright,,,2,One more attempt alright
105,567.03,569.85,2,So we can try and,,,,1,So we can try and
106,580.53,583.02,2,I don't know it's probably better if the same hand,,,,1,I don't know it's probably better if the same hand
107,583.92,585.9,2,,Yeah,,,2,Yeah
108,590.79,597.51,2,I don't know I mean,I'm feeling the one fifty personally but,Wait what it it again when it's lined up,,2,I'm feeling the one fifty personally but
109,597.9,602.55,2,Um think yeah these are ten,That's a ten ten that's a twenty,,,2,That's a ten ten that's a twenty
110,602.91,604.98,2,,Fifty and that's a thirty,,,2,Fifty and that's a thirty
111,607.98,612.63,2,,And we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or,,,2,And we guessed this was a one forty so our options were one thirty or
112,612.75,614.73,2,,Off the paper,,,2,Off the paper
113,616.02,618,2,,Together that's one twenty,,,2,Together that's one twenty
114,619.95,624.9,2,,Um personally,I think it has to do with patterns,,3,I think it has to do with patterns
115,625.26,629.07,2,,,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks,,3,Because it says think about the relationship between the weights of the power blocks
116,629.58,632.49,2,,Oh yeah  ,And if you do like,,3,And if you do like
117,633.6,635.91,2,,,,,0,
118,637.71,639.99,2,,,These add up to twenty,,3,These add up to twenty
119,640.29,642.9,2,,,These add up to thirty these add up to fifty,,3,These add up to thirty these add up to fifty
120,644.79,647.37,2,,,But that doesn't really make sense either I don't know,,3,But that doesn't really make sense either I don't know
121,647.49,649.47,2,Yeah I mean this could be,,,,1,Yeah I mean this could be

123,655.86,661.77,2,,So these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty,So it would be eighty and you weigh less,,2,So these would add up to eighty and then eighty plus fifty would be one thirty
124,664.32,666.3,2,,,And thirty ,,3,And thirty 
125,673.68,676.8,2,,,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty,,3,I think it's just the last two so it would just be fifty and thirty

127,680.52,686.01,2,Yeah that might make sense,Were we right then,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that,,3,A lot heavier because it's denser and like just carrying that
128,686.58,689.04,2,,,No you're wrong it was eighty,,3,No you're wrong it was eighty
129,689.13,692.94,2,Yeah it's a pattern,Really,Cause I think we did one step too much,,3,Cause I think we did one step too much
