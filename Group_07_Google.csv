Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4,
0,2.91,5.52,7,,,,I need to callibrate my cameras first,
1,9.63,11.61,7,,,,,
2,13.77,17.94,7,,,,Okay um and if you could flip that paper over for me,
3,18.15,23.01,7,,,,There will be content on that paper. Okay,
4,23.13,25.71,7,,,,the task that you are completing is called the weights task,
5,26.31,30.21,7,,,,part one you will work together to determine the weights of the five colorable cubes,
6,31.05,34.08,7,,,,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams,
7,34.77,38.37,7,,,,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale here,
8,39.27,43.86,7,,,,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to touch the slider on the scale,
9,44.37,50.28,7,,,,The scale is not perfect so as long as one side doesn't drop down you can assume that the weights are equal,
10,50.94,53.52,7,,,,Uh you will place the blocks onto these,
11,53.7,56.55,7,,,,onto the worksheet once you have determined their weight,
12,56.91,59.58,7,,,,And you will also enter the weight into this survey here,
13,59.88,63.54,7,,,Okay,You guys are going to be group number seven and you can go ahead and get started,
14,64.11,66.51,7,,,Do I just type in the group number now or,Yeah,
15,71.58,73.56,7,,,,,
16,74.07,76.2,7,,,Okay,Yeah,
17,76.47,81.24,7,,Let's start with the smallest block,,,
18,81.69,83.79,7,,,Um,,
19,88.44,90.42,7,,,,,
20,92.19,95.52,7,Yeah almost,,Yeah.,,
21,97.53,106.08,7,,,I think so as well or I think it's the other way around uh. Yeah,,
22,107.1,109.35,7,Okay,It seems to be ten,,,
23,110.34,115.71,7,,Is that blue or purple this is blue I guess,Yeah uh. This is blue,,
24,116.58,121.68,7,,and we can now we have twenty so we can,And this was ten. Okay,,
25,121.71,124.47,7,,try to put one of them,Sure,,
26,124.62,128.1,7,,,Oh that's the heaviest,,
27,128.79,132.21,7,Oh,Oh this seems to heavy,Okay,,
28,134.37,136.35,7,,,,,
29,136.77,138.84,7,Think it should be,,,,
30,139.86,143.4,7,,,Yeah they should be twenty as well. Uhh,,
31,146.01,150.63,7,Yeah. Green,,Okay. Should I put this as twenty,,
32,151.56,154.59,7,Now it's forty,,Okay,,
33,154.62,156.69,7,This is,,And,,
34,157.65,160.8,7,No no no that's silly,You can try I'm always,,,
35,161.19,165.12,7,This one or this one,think that's heavier. Yeah yeah yeah that's lighter yeah,,,
36,165.3,167.28,7,,,,,
37,168.12,170.1,7,,,,,
38,179.43,182.52,7,Thirty,,Yeah I think it's yeah thirty,,
39,182.73,185.43,7,,,Yup,,
40,185.55,187.83,7,,,Okay,,
41,188.58,190.71,7,,,Ummm,,
42,190.77,192.75,7,,,,,
43,192.84,195.6,7,,So is twenty and there is thirty,,,
44,203.16,205.14,7,,twenty plus,,,
45,205.44,207.42,7,Thirty,Thirty,,,
46,207.51,211.74,7,,it's not exactly aligning but it could be,No no no no,,
47,212.22,219.36,7,,Fifty I guess,So if we. No,,
48,220.23,223.83,7,,,,,
49,226.56,230.13,7,,Fifty and the purple is,Yeah I think fifty seems right,,
50,230.52,232.53,7,,Thirty thirty plus twenty,,,
51,233.76,235.74,7,Yeah,,Yup,,
52,236.79,245.64,7,I'm sorry. It purple is thirty,Uh itís not exactly aligning,Fifty. Oh purple is thirty. Uh yellow,,
53,245.73,252.27,7,Do you want to put ten. It is,should I. So this seem it's little more. Yeah so should I put something here,On the left,,
54,252.63,254.61,7,,,We can try it yeah,,
55,255.18,259.17,7,I should we should keep ten,No,No,,
56,260.25,262.26,7,,But then that'll even this is,,,
57,263.19,265.17,7,,This is ten ok we know that this is ten,,,
58,265.29,274.92,7,Now it's completely now,Yeah but we put both ten so that they cancel out,Yeah. No it's still on the left,,
59,275.4,277.95,7,,,And you mean like this,,
60,279,281.34,7,,So this is thirty oops sorry,,,
61,281.4,283.8,7,,Thirty plus thirty plus  ,Thirty,,
62,283.86,286.05,7,,Fifty,And then yeah. Yeah,,
63,286.92,288.9,7,,,,,
64,289.86,291.84,7,,,,,
65,293.79,295.77,7,,,,,
66,297.93,299.91,7,,,So,,
67,300.93,311.13,7,It's okay or we should just us scale it with this one,,Yeah how about we try like twenty and then,,
68,311.91,316.5,7,It's it's two gram I think,,,,
69,317.25,320.4,7,It has until five but,,,,
70,320.49,322.71,7,we can,,,,
71,323.19,329.25,7,It's five gram now. It's,What does this do,Yeah it's. I don't know,,
72,329.4,335.28,7,mmm it's this way plus five. So you can,,Oh,,
73,337.53,339.84,7,,,,,
74,340.26,344.94,7,So you should add something here,,Oh ok so it could be,,
75,345.27,347.25,7,,,,,
76,347.28,350.34,7,,So now we're adding three grams where,Or here,,
77,351.81,353.79,7,,,So we're adding,,
78,354.27,357.33,7,,Where are we adding,,,
79,358.41,363.39,7,Going to this one. Yeah,There,So if you move it there then we're adding like five grams. Yeah to that one,,
80,363.99,367.95,7,,it's divided it's two point five and two point five so it can't be,,,
81,370.2,376.02,7,,So uh,So is it to the right right now like the scale,,
82,378.48,386.01,7,But it doesn't have any,Yeah but we put both ten so that they cancel out. Are we allowed to ask questions,Like the center scale is it to the right. Okay so,,
83,387.24,393.93,7,,,I donít are we allowed to ask questions or no,To clarify you don't need to use the slider at all they will all be in intervals of ten grams,
84,394.05,399.12,7,Ah yeah because yeah. So it's fifty,So now we've kind of destructed everything,Oh okay. So,,
85,399.3,401.28,7,,,Okay. Uhh,,
86,403.41,407.13,7,,,So if it's an interval of ten it should be forty but,,
87,408.33,411.45,7,,,It's more balanced with fifty grams,,
88,416.13,418.11,7,,,Ummm,,
89,418.83,426.48,7,Fifty,Fifty. Fifty,Oops oh I donít know. Yeah I think so,,
90,429.15,432.87,7,It's slightly off,,Otherwise uh like it wasnít balanced with,,
91,433.02,436.89,7,,It's slightly to the left that's what it,Yeah,,
92,437.76,444.87,7,,It could be forty but can we measure forty,But like the scale isn't properly aligned as well so,,
93,445.68,449.94,7,,So that is thirty plus ten so that is purple,So. So green,,
94,450.63,454.41,7,,Purple plus red I guess,Okay,,
95,456.39,460.8,7,,No. Okay I think it's fifty,No. Okay,,
96,461.16,464.28,7,,,Yeah uh,,
97,468.72,476.61,7,,That is correct. Red is ten. Yellow is fifty. Purple was thirty,Yeah. I think so so red ten. Yeah,,
98,478.29,482.79,7,Kay,,Update your worksheet and,,
99,483.57,486.66,7,,,,,
100,488.01,491.07,7,,,And,,
101,491.13,493.35,7,,,Green was,,
102,494.43,496.83,7,,,Twenty and purple was thirty,,
103,497.4,499.38,7,,,Yep,,
104,500.4,502.38,7,,,We're done,,
105,505.83,508.5,7,,,,,
106,508.59,511.38,7,,,,,
107,511.53,513.51,7,,,,,
108,514.11,517.77,7,,,,you will now determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale.,
109,517.8,520.83,7,,,,You will have two attempts and you can now begin the survey,
110,521.13,523.98,7,,,Okay,,
111,526.08,529.59,7,,,Like Feels weird on your hands,,
112,530.01,534.12,7,,Maybe um maybe first you can try don't say it aloud,,,
113,534.51,540.48,7,Okay,You can try it don't say it aloud so that we don't biased,Okay. Yeah,,
114,540.84,546.75,7,,Should we turn or something so that we don't biased,I can start,,
115,547.02,549.87,7,,Should we as well I don't we won't look,,,
116,550.74,552.78,7,,,,,
117,558.12,562.32,7,,So is it also in like multiples of ten the weight,Yes,,
118,570.15,572.13,7,,,,,
119,585.42,587.88,7,,,,,
120,591.75,608.94,7,Do you need help. Ok you go,ok you both try not to look so that,I donít know like could somebody else like try. Ok I can yeah. I think we have like two attempts to,,
121,609.15,614.7,7,,,tell it to you yeah. Okay so like we can discuss it amongst ourselves,Oh you'll input it into the survey,
122,615.42,618.93,7,,,Like we have to input it here so there will be like two tries,,
123,620.58,631.14,7,So it's this last try,okay,Yes. No no we can like talk about it amongst ourselves we just have like two tries to like fill it in,,
124,644.58,647.22,7,,Yellow is fifty right,Yeah,,
125,651.21,653.31,7,,,,,
126,655.29,657.27,7,,,,,
127,658.05,660.3,7,,,,,
128,661.86,663.84,7,,,,,
129,666.18,668.16,7,,I think this is,,,
130,668.43,675.06,7,,seventy,Do you want to like it felt more heavier to me I donít know,,
131,675.51,677.61,7,,More than seventy,Yeah like,,
132,677.79,681.75,7,,Maybe um like,I tried it with all the blocks,,
133,681.78,684.06,7,,picking like this might also help,,,
134,684.12,689.28,7,What about put it on,because you are distributing with three fingers,,,
135,689.4,692.88,7,Two finger,,Yeah,,
136,695.22,701.16,7,,It's like difficult I'll have to place it for you maybe,,,
137,702.27,704.25,7,,,,,
138,706.35,708.57,7,I think I need more,,,,
139,709.38,711.69,7,,,Okay uh Purple was heavier,,
140,715.14,717.6,7,they are equal.,Now it's equal,,,
141,717.63,726.06,7,Yeah,So this is uh thirty plus purple is,Okay. Uh yellow was fifty and,,
142,726.6,731.55,7,,,this was twenty. And this was thirty,,
143,731.73,741.48,7,,this is eighty okay. So what do you think. How did you hold it,Yeah. I think I thought like even all of these combined were. Like this,,
144,742.14,744.48,7,,on three fingers,Yes like Yep,,
145,747.15,749.13,7,,Okay so ,,,
146,751.53,753.9,7,,One two,this seems more,,
147,753.99,761.16,7,,three fingers I guess it might matter which fingers we're holding with I don't know,Yeah like how about you try and,,
148,762.36,764.34,7,,,Okay,,
149,766.32,768.51,7,,I'll try holding it here,Okay,,
150,774.03,777.81,7,,the same. Can you put it on my,,,
151,778.29,780.27,7,,two fingers,,,
152,782.85,788.49,7,,,Yeah. Yeah maybe using three would be better,,
153,796.35,798.33,7,,,Yeah,,
154,802.62,804.84,7,Because I think,,,,
155,805.32,815.88,7,Because it's not just when we weighed itís not just the weight it's could be,very difficult I donít know what side it is. Like if you pick it up like this so this is why I felt it is seventy is because I was holding it,,,
156,816.18,823.08,7,Yeah,like this. But now it does feel heavier actually now that you mention it,Yeah,,
157,824.79,832.35,7,So how about those two I had. Eh these two,,Uh Green was Twenty this is thirty this is fifty,,
158,834.39,836.37,7,,,,,
159,838.14,841.08,7,,Yeah something's heavier,Yeah,,
160,841.44,843.54,7,,,How about,,
161,843.66,846.99,7,,Is there a better way to measure it,,,
162,847.47,850.62,7,,,Like if we were just measuring like one block we could just,,
163,850.65,853.53,7,,,drop it to the ground the heavier one would fall first,,
164,853.68,856.41,7,Or. Like,,Yeah,,
165,856.68,859.59,7,,,Yeah but uh hmm,,
166,862.14,864.12,7,,,Uh,,
167,866.7,874.02,7,I think it should be ,no I said seventy but now it could be more I donít know,So you said eighty and you think,,
168,874.26,882.33,7,,Actually feel this is equal to the combined weight of all of this now. Is there. Is there,Yeah hmm,,
169,883.17,885.9,7,,for which part of the hand is more sensitive,,,
170,886.44,888.42,7,,,like,,
171,889.02,891.18,7,,,generally this one,,
172,891.3,893.55,7,,,Like the palm I think,,
173,894.3,896.64,7,,,,,
174,897.93,900.06,7,,very heavy okay so,,,
175,900.96,905.19,7,,,How about you hold this in one hand and what we'll do is like,,
176,905.34,908.22,7,,Can we like use a string,,,
177,908.37,918.6,7,Oh sorry,No but we can't,Yeah. Oh sorry no go ahead. So what if you like put this in one hand and we like had,,
178,918.66,920.82,7,,,move like one block,,
179,920.94,923.85,7,,,from like the other hand to this hand and see like when it,,
180,923.91,926.19,7,,,becomes heavier or lighter,,
181,926.25,928.5,7,,,Uh Okay,,
182,930.15,932.73,7,,,,,
183,933.51,937.77,7,,,Yeah,,
184,938.82,942.72,7,,I donít think the palm is the most sensitive,this here. No,,
185,943.83,950.01,7,,So if there was a way to hold it like this I think this is more sensitive,Okay,,
186,951.75,955.77,7,,definitely heavier I feel like,Uh,,
187,955.83,957.81,7,,,I would right now,,
188,958.47,982.11,7,I forgot the name of that but in the physic when you have eight under um larger area what was that. Sorry. Uh no no the name of that in the physic. Perhaps I can see the. At least,Surface area Surface area,Uh pressure. Uh oh. Uh I donít think we can we use our phones or,,
189,982.32,985.92,7,I want to see a word. No it's okay,,,,
190,986.25,991.59,7,Density yeah. I think density,,Yeah,,
191,991.68,994.05,7,,,,,
192,995.76,998.25,7,,could be the same can you try it now or,,,
193,998.94,1006.98,7,,So I uh maybe I'll try removing weights and I'll add also weights and then we can try to callibrate,Okay yeah yeah,,
194,1008,1009.98,7,,,,,
195,1013.67,1018.02,7,,Just keep trying different things,Yeah now like this is heavier yeah,,
196,1019.52,1021.5,7,,,Seems closer,,
197,1022.61,1033.29,7,,I think we should try very fast so that you become more aware before you get used to it,Yeah yup uh I don't know uh,,
198,1036.44,1040.91,7,,,think good yard uh yeah this one,,
199,1041.87,1043.85,7,,,this seems similar as well,,
200,1045.62,1047.84,7,,,Close enough uh,,
201,1048.47,1058.94,7,,So it's definitely this much,Yeah so like when you add like the red and blue I don't think it makes that much of a difference but. But it could be,,
202,1059.33,1062.18,7,,,this much or like with like,,
203,1062.66,1070.73,7,Okay,Like plus or minus. Do you want to try that. So hold it like that because it's more,Yeah. Yeah. Yeah like they're so,,
204,1072.56,1076.76,7,,Um Okay. I'll be adding and removing very quickly so,,,
205,1086.63,1092,7,,Yeah donít rest your wrists yeah,Yeah try to hold it like a bit higher I think like. Yeah,,
206,1094.52,1096.5,7,Yeah,,,,
207,1098.39,1100.37,7,This just fits me,,,,
208,1106.52,1108.5,7,,,,,
209,1111.83,1118.7,7,I think all of them. Yeah I think it's between these two,Is it the same or now what do you feel,,,
210,1119.09,1122.36,7,Yeah because when you put it you put that on,,Okay,,
211,1123.83,1128.06,7,When you put yeah when you put this one its heavier,,,,
212,1128.21,1135.56,7,the blue the blue. Now it's they are they feel,both are ten each,Uh the red one. Oh yeah uh no,,
213,1135.65,1139.64,7,Yes,,Okay so it's like either all of these or with blue,,
214,1140.57,1151.31,7,Do you want to try that. I just want to make sure. We can start with the smaller one,Is there a better I mean now we are almost sure,Okay. Yeah,,
215,1151.67,1159.44,7,put on the smaller because it is because it is,,I don't ,,
216,1160.7,1166.04,7,,I don't think so. Like putting weights,No. Okay,,
217,1167.09,1172.97,7,,,Or like but where it's somehow. Uh,,
218,1174.86,1176.84,7,,,Oh I uh like,,
219,1176.9,1178.94,7,I think we should,,,,
220,1179.06,1183.05,7,You should take it like this,,Yeah hold it like this yeah,,
221,1183.29,1185.45,7,,,And,,
222,1185.54,1188.24,7,,,Oh,,
223,1188.63,1190.7,7,Yeah it's it's uh,,,,
224,1191.54,1193.82,7,,,,,
225,1197.18,1202.13,7,Yeah I think we need more,,Okay what does it. More,,
226,1202.52,1204.5,7,,,,,
227,1208.55,1210.53,7,Yeah,,Still more,,
228,1211.16,1213.14,7,,,Mmm,,
229,1213.86,1216.56,7,,,about now,,
230,1216.68,1219.92,7,,Am I holding it right in the center I hope,I,,
231,1220.13,1223.25,7,,,think so,,
232,1223.64,1227.3,7,I donít know why but because maybe it's very,,,,
233,1229.4,1231.92,7,,,,,
234,1235.07,1239.12,7,,,Yeah but yeah,,
235,1239.72,1243.92,7,,like this,Could you like make it more like no no uh more,,
236,1243.98,1246.92,7,,Like this,yeah go right there like,,
237,1247.04,1253.76,7,,,yeah like that. So where is oh yellow is,,
238,1255.05,1257.03,7,,,,,
239,1258.2,1260.48,7,,,And,,
240,1261.74,1263.99,7,,,I think it's slanted this way,,
241,1264.44,1266.42,7,Yeah,,,,
242,1267.23,1273.8,7,,Is it is it because I'm holding it incorrect,I think so. Can I try holding it yeah,,
243,1274.16,1277.76,7,,If we had like a string that could,How about,,
244,1278.12,1281.51,7,,Okay so we definitely know that this is,try doing it now,,
245,1281.54,1289.04,7,So if you oh I see ,,Uh this is the mystery block yes,,
246,1289.64,1301.04,7,It sounds like,You should be holding this. We definitely know that it's,Yeah so. Uh yeah how about you add it first and then I'll pick it up and see how heavy,,
247,1301.1,1306.02,7,Which one is the biggest one,,Yea so. So the biggest one is yellow,,
248,1306.32,1310.1,7,,,,,
249,1311.63,1317.9,7,,It's not a good method I think. It's not a good method,Yeah,,
250,1317.96,1326.21,7,What about that one but we start from a smaller one we should try that,,Hmm okay,,
251,1326.27,1334.64,7,Yeah you um just keep them but from the small one,,Yeah we start from the smallest no uh in your hands,,
252,1335.18,1339.17,7,,,Yeah like you hold it the same way but we start with like the smallest,,
253,1343.34,1347.03,7,,Feels heavier,How does it feel right now. Okay,,
254,1350.69,1352.67,7,,,,,
255,1353.69,1355.67,7,,Still heavier,Okay,,
256,1358.61,1361.07,7,,,I think that would be heavier now,,
257,1363.83,1365.96,7,,Same Around the same,,,
258,1366.05,1371.12,7,,,Okay how about uh no no uh could you put the blue one back yeah,,
259,1371.63,1374.57,7,,,Uh and we'll like remove one of them,,
260,1378.41,1381.59,7,,Yeah this is heavier now. The right side,This is heavier now,,
261,1381.74,1383.72,7,,,Okay uh,,
262,1384.05,1389.06,7,What was the weight of that,,I think this was twenty. Let's uh,,
263,1389.75,1391.73,7,,,change,,
264,1393.59,1395.57,7,,,,,
265,1397.07,1399.05,7,,,,,
266,1400.28,1402.62,7,,Heavier,This is okay,,
267,1403.25,1405.23,7,,,And,,
268,1405.5,1408.83,7,,,Sorry,,
269,1413.15,1415.46,7,,,,,
270,1418.49,1420.68,7,,,,,
271,1422.03,1425.18,7,,This is heavier right side I think,,,
272,1425.27,1427.25,7,,,Okay uh,,
273,1427.67,1431.03,7,,Now you try because I'm getting used to it,Oh,,
274,1431.15,1434.51,7,Because when,,uh. I donít okay sure,,
275,1435.71,1437.69,7,,,So,,
276,1439.97,1442.55,7,,,I will keep my eyes closed,,
277,1444.44,1446.42,7,,,This is heavier the right side,,
278,1448.37,1450.47,7,,,Uh,,
279,1450.77,1454.76,7,,You can always uh like your right hand side you can always,,,
280,1454.88,1457.04,7,,put it down and pick it up again because you might get,,,
281,1457.07,1459.71,7,, used to it,Oh okay uh,,
282,1460.94,1463.7,7,,similar,Seems similar,,
283,1463.82,1466.4,7,,can you put down the right side and pick it up again,,,
284,1469.82,1472.82,7,,Right side is heavy,Yeah no this is heavy. Yeah,,
285,1473,1484.34,7,,Okay stop stop. Because I felt that was heavier you felt that this was heavier. So we neeed to,Yeah. No uh when you felt it was heavier it was like this three blocks,,
286,1485.09,1497,7,,These four you mean. Was it. So it means,Uh yeah these four blocks not the green one. Yeah. So it's between like these two. How about you try uh,,
287,1497.93,1500.54,7,,,try it with this one since we know like,,
288,1500.81,1503.42,7,,,this is the heaviest that we know of,,
289,1504.08,1507.89,7,,,and we put some random ones uh,,
290,1515.51,1517.67,7,,feels heavier,Okay,,
291,1518.78,1529.76,7,Really but it wasn't.,Yeah.. It feel the same,Yeah. Okay so. Okay,,
292,1530.45,1532.43,7,,,Uh,,
293,1532.55,1535.67,7,,,This one which one feels similar,,
294,1538.25,1543.83,7,I think we should callibrate for example these,,,,
295,1548.42,1552.41,7,No we should callibrate like this and we put,,,,
296,1552.44,1557.12,7, other thing and we remove one thing,,Yeah I think,,
297,1557.21,1573.77,7,And we add and we donít say to you that what we add or we and finally we find,These are equal,that is a good idea like we use same weights initially and then add like different. Yeah yeah but you need to like keep your eyes closed for that,,
298,1573.86,1577.31,7,And we just um mix this,this is thirty and this,,,
299,1577.43,1582.5,7,,Oh this is fifty,That is fifty this is twenty yes and this is thirty,,
300,1582.98,1585.11,7,,Fifty twenty thirty,Yes,,
301,1585.95,1595.61,7,No no just start with these and we add different things until you said they are equal,Also let's do a combine together,,,
302,1597.77,1600.59,7,Just  ,,,,
303,1607.37,1611.75,7,So you should,,Okay,,
304,1611.78,1614.78,7,those at first that they are,,,,
305,1621.05,1624.83,7,,is heavier,Okay uh,,
306,1624.89,1626.87,7,,,how about now,,
307,1632.63,1634.61,7,,,And now,,
308,1643.43,1645.98,7,,heavier,And now,,
309,1653.06,1656.3,7,,Same,Okay I,,
310,1656.63,1659.36,7,,,okay could you like put them down,,
311,1659.48,1668.72,7,It doesnít feel correct,So that,yeah. I donít okay so like uh,,
312,1668.75,1681.11,7,,this is equal. This is fifty ten sixty sixty plus six so this is ninety,So if like these feel similar so. Fifty. Thirty,,
313,1681.71,1687.95,7,,And this is. Thirty ninety minus thirty sixty,Ten twenty thirty is sixty,,
314,1688.67,1693.92,7,Which one was fifty,we lock sixty,Uh this one was fifty,,
315,1694.37,1696.68,7,,You're sure about that right,Yeah,,
316,1697.22,1703.52,7,,Let's since we already have something let's close your eyes,Yeah,,
317,1703.85,1705.83,7,,,,,
318,1706.16,1708.77,7,I should feel like this,,,,
319,1710.33,1712.31,7,,,,,
320,1716.24,1718.22,7,,,,,
321,1718.76,1720.74,7,,,,,
322,1721.22,1728.51,7,This one,This was in the same group,Which one is heavier. Yeah,,
323,1732.17,1737.21,7,It's heavier. It's this one,Which one. Left one,How about now,,
324,1737.81,1744.95,7,Yes. Yeah I feel heavier,For serious,Your left hand yeah ok this is heavier ok uh,,
325,1747.89,1749.87,7,,,How about now,,
326,1754.82,1757.34,7,I feel heavier,Which one,Left one,,
327,1758.09,1760.82,7,,,Okay how about now,,
328,1766.43,1768.47,7,same,,Okay,,
329,1768.56,1772.19,7,,This is how much,okay uh you can put them down. So we have like,,
330,1772.25,1779.18,7,,,like this is twenty. So we have like two answers and we have like two tries. So,,
331,1779.69,1790.28,7,,Do you do you want to try it again. So this is uh either sixty or,uh this is the. Nah I think I'm good. Yeah we've got like uh. So,,
332,1791.06,1793.49,7,,or eighty right,plus thirty fifty,,
333,1794.36,1796.34,7,,,uh,,
334,1797.09,1802.04,7,,Or eighty right because,So like the first option is sixty which or eighty,,
335,1802.49,1806.78,7,,Because this was heavier that means it has to be eighty,I think so yeah fifty thirty,,
336,1807.47,1809.45,7,,, isn't this a hundred,,
337,1810.17,1812.15,7,,,twenty thirty and fifty,,
338,1812.51,1814.49,7,,,So either a hundred or,,
339,1814.55,1818.75,7,I think we need to add sixty,Sixty or eighty,sixty no,,
340,1818.96,1826.46,7,It's eighty,I don't know. Do you feel it's the same,So like this was one block that Shadi tried. Right,,
341,1827.6,1838.76,7,,So either a hundred or sixty but that's too steep a jump,So fifty plus thirty plus twenty is a hundred yeah and the other block was,,
342,1838.79,1852.71,7,I think we should go with ninety and eighty ,,We could try first eighty eighty first. Okay. Yeah. Should I put an eighty final okay,,
343,1853.61,1861.38,7,,,Um oh eighty,,
344,1862.58,1864.56,7,,,Yup and then let's,,
345,1864.86,1868.61,7,,,Okay uh ten ten,,
346,1869.81,1872.21,7,,,twenty thirty,,
347,1872.63,1875.06,7,,,eighty and fifty,,
348,1876.29,1879.38,7,,,,For the final part of this task,
349,1879.41,1882.92,7,,,,read the scenario and estimate the weight of the second mystery,
350,1883.76,1888.26,7,,,,You will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you can now continue the survey,
351,1888.98,1891.77,7,,Which is the missing second block,,,
352,1892.31,1894.74,7,,,Uh,,
353,1909.02,1920.18,7,It should be something like. It should be,The second mystery block,Does this not seem like the Fibonacci sequence like one one two,,
354,1920.39,1922.37,7,,,three five eight,,
355,1922.67,1925.61,7,Yeah,, and then one thirty,,
356,1926.06,1931.13,7,,,Yeah,,
357,1931.49,1934.16,7,,two three,,,
358,1936.29,1942.74,7,,So that should be eight plus five so thirteen,Five plus three eight. Which is,,
359,1943.61,1950.3,7,Are we sure,,I like. Yeah like it seems the obvious pattern,,
360,1955.34,1957.65,7,,,Okay,,
361,1958.25,1960.23,7,can't have,,,,
362,1960.8,1964.19,7,Actually we can't have forty because,,,,
363,1964.91,1971.06,7,one we can't have sixty we have this seventy we have these two eighty,,,,
364,1971.21,1975.23,7,But we can't oh yeah it's it's Fibonacci,,Yeah,,
365,1978.05,1980.03,7,,,Yeah like if,,
366,1980.06,1982.7,7,,Yeah one thirty,I think so. Okay,,
367,1983.21,1985.19,7,,,um,,
368,1987.65,1994.73,7,,,If anybody else wants to type,,
369,2015.34,2017.47,7,,,Yeah,,
370,2020.08,2024.49,7,Maybe we should guess the weight of that with Fibonacci as well,,,,
371,2025.09,2030.88,7,No I mean this one based on the other,Yeah that was one thirty so it'll be,This one yeah so one one two three,,
372,2031.45,2034.96,7,Yeah,, five and then three plus five is eight. Yeah,,
373,2036.16,2038.44,7,,,,,
374,2040.18,2042.43,7,,,,,
375,2049.06,2051.73,7,,,I think so,,
376,2051.85,2057.25,7,,We placed the in the correct position so it was easy to see that they fit into the Fibonacci series,,,
377,2058.45,2060.43,7,,,Yeah I think that is fine,,
378,2063.16,2067.96,7,,Hey,Yeah,,
379,2073.75,2074.59,7,,,,,
