Utterance,Start,End,Group,1,2,3,4
0,0.33,4.32,4,,,,Ok I'm going to callibrate my cameras
1,4.77,7.02,4,,,,
2,8.16,10.56,4,,,,
3,11.67,14.1,4,,,,I'm sorry I feel like this didn't catch up
4,14.64,16.71,4,,,,Ok  
5,16.83,23.97,4,I don't know if I have to be serious or not,That was awkward,,
6,24.96,32.4,4,,,,So the task you are completing today is called the weights task in the first part you are going to work together to determine the weights of the cube
7,33.3,36.24,4,,,,I will tell you that the red cube is ten grams
8,36.78,40.38,4,,,,You will determine the weights of the remaining cubes using the scale provided
9,41.13,45,4,,,,All of the weights are in intervals of ten grams so you don't need to use the slider
10,45.72,52.8,4,Oh and we don't touch the scale yet,,,Um the scale is not perfect so as long as one side does not drop completely you can assume the weights are fairly equal
11,54.45,56.85,4,,,,You must place the weights onto this
12,57.36,70.8,4,Ok so you want us to do,Ok so the red has ten,Uh they are not all weight this has more weight oh we're group four so we press enter here,Place the cubes under the worksheet and then also fill out the survey in line as you go and you can now start oh and you're group four
13,72.21,80.64,4,,Yeah,Well then no let's compare the red to the blue to see if we can get a baseline to the blue,
14,80.79,83.1,4,Well the top is a ten,,,
15,83.58,86.13,4,Once it stops,Is it,,
16,89.82,97.32,4,Ok there easy so this is twenty yeah cause this is ten as long as it's not dropping it's the same,Is it ten and this was equal to this one,,
17,97.83,99.96,4,And then this was,,,
18,103.08,105.93,4,Perfect,Ok  ,,
19,106.05,112.77,4,I feel like this one is oh yeah so this is,Take off a ten,Put the twenty on there take off a ten,
20,112.98,114.96,4,,,,
21,116.34,118.32,4,So it's not,,,
22,119.94,127.41,4,It doesn't drop completely yeah we can consider this to be thirty then yeah because it doesn’t drop,Can we yeah and it's obviously not foty,Can we,
23,127.47,130.62,4,,Well it's not and it's not twenty yeah it's gotta be thirty,,
24,130.65,139.95,4,,Ok can we write on this paper oh well it's a good try to put in our head,Yeah ok so that's thirty are we writing this down somewhere,No you just set the block wherever it goes 
25,140.61,145.8,4,,Wait that oh yeah oh ok,And then we want,Um you should be writing it down on the worksheet
26,147.06,151.89,4,Oh on there,,,
27,152.73,154.71,4,,,,
28,155.04,161.79,4,Ok so we can say that this is fifty,Not fifty,Uh so yellow we or red and blue there's no there's no ok,
29,161.88,163.86,4,Blue is ten,Sixty right,,
30,164.67,170.31,4,No this is twenty you're off the team,Weren't those both thirty or no only one of them twenty and thirty,Twenty and then,
31,170.46,177.06,4,Yeah  ,I've been cut,And so that would mean yellow is fifty,
32,177.87,182.61,4,This took someone twenty minutes,,Alright we all happy with that we happy with these solutions,
33,183.06,187.35,4,Yeah,Yellow is fifty green green is a twenty right,Blue's ten green is a twenty right,
34,187.44,191.04,4,Yeah yeah definitely,Yeah I can see how we can try,,
35,191.46,195.96,4,Purple is thirty forty yeah they're fifty,,,
36,196.83,200.85,4,,So it's like that,Hey cool,
37,201.03,203.01,4,,,,
38,203.1,206.01,4,Did um so did,,We can see the first part of the task,
39,206.04,208.5,4,,,,
40,209.31,212.34,4,,,Oh there's a new thing without a scale,
41,213.51,217.65,4,,,,Now you will determine the weight of this mystery block without using the scale
42,217.77,219.75,4,,,,You will have two attempts to enter the weight correctly
43,220.29,226.71,4,,,Ok I vote here's my vote alright,
44,227.07,237.63,4,,Yeah ok I'm not going to look at what you guys do,"We each go around, we each come up with a weight ourselves and then we vote then don't look at what we do",
45,237.96,241.29,4,,,,
46,241.38,243.87,4,,You're just like making out,,
47,243.93,246.27,4,Dude,,,
48,248.85,250.83,4,,,,
49,254.19,256.17,4,,,,
50,259.23,261.21,4,,,,
51,261.84,263.97,4,,,,
52,268.32,274.62,4,,Intrusive thoughts,,
53,277.02,279,4,,,,
54,282.15,291.63,4,,Dude what,I'm done why is there another block over there,
55,294,296.07,4,Block,,,
56,297.9,300.33,4,I'll google what it is,,,
57,302.31,306.36,4,,This is tough this is really tough actually,,
58,306.96,311.79,4,,,But by voting we get a better chance statistically of being correct,
59,311.91,314.34,4,,True very true,,
60,318.39,320.76,4,,How are you holding them like I don't I guess I'll,,
61,325.44,327.78,4,,,,
62,331.8,333.78,4,,,,
63,334.95,336.93,4,,,,
64,344.64,348.84,4,,,,
65,349.56,351.96,4,,,,
66,352.44,356.01,4,,I guess we can launch in can't we,,
67,356.97,359.31,4,,No pressure,,
68,360,362.34,4,,,,
69,365.31,368.73,4,,You having fun,,
70,371.46,373.59,4,Friction,,,
71,373.95,380.1,4,,,We get any sort of feedback if we enter any correctly is it higher or lower or are we going to get that wrong,
72,381.75,386.94,4,,,Because you said we get two attempts so will we feedback saying we were too high or too low,You will get some type of feedback
73,387.99,390.33,4,,,Ok,
74,391.14,394.05,4,,,So in that case we should change our strategy,
75,394.11,401.13,4,,Probably not supposed to know,What is the type of feedback we get,
76,401.34,403.32,4,,,,
77,406.59,408.57,4,,,,
78,410.1,412.38,4,,Oh interesting,,
79,412.47,420.75,4,,,I mean we could make a,
80,421.71,426.39,4,,Cheating I think I don't know probably,Is it though,
81,428.94,433.92,4,Can we use the floor I need a frictionless surface,Why don't you just,,
82,435.24,438.21,4,Is this the same or,,,
83,440.13,444.63,4,,How are you measuring your force,Yeah how are you being exact in your force,
84,446.79,454.11,4,I just wanted to apply this,I mean weight is still physics,,
85,454.14,456.12,4,True  ,,,
86,456.9,458.88,4,,,,
87,459.51,465.99,4,,I don't have a good answer just so you know I have like a range of somewhat,I have a range as well,
88,466.26,468.24,4,This one feels best for me,,,
89,468.63,470.61,4,,Seem I'm between that and all of them,,
90,470.79,478.47,4,,Really ok,I thought it was closer to yellow green and like a red,
91,478.77,483.21,4,No way no way,Yeah let me show that to him,,
92,486.96,494.4,4,,Yeah no shot no shot I think this is a good way to do it actually side is kind of hard,Do that again,
93,495.21,499.17,4,,,Yeah you guys are right so if you do,
94,499.26,504.06,4,,Well I think I mean we eliminated some like,I like how we abandoned the voting,
95,504.48,506.46,4,,That's where I thought was pretty good,,
96,507.15,520.74,4,This one feels good this one for some reason feels weird yeah I know ok so fifties,But it's hard to say it makes it look almost lighter well I mean,Alright I'm ok with this so that's,
97,520.86,526.11,4,,Yeah this is pretty good,It would be fifty plus thirty so one ten,
98,527.73,532.26,4,Moment of truth yeah that makes one twenty,Yeah I am,We happy with one ten,
99,532.29,534.45,4,,Yeah,,
100,534.87,543.06,4,,,It's not quite correct think about the relationship between weights of the prior blocks and use a pattern to determine the weight of the mystery block,
101,543.12,556.14,4,Is it fibonacci oh my gosh,So it's like these these two god,Ten ten twenty thirty fifty so plus plus it's fibonnaci it's fucking fibonnaci,
102,556.53,564.6,4,,I saw something wasn't there something about fibonacci in the form,So ten plus ten is twenty twenty plus ten is thirty thirty plus twenty is fifty so it's eighty so I was fucking right,
103,564.87,569.82,4,Yeah I guess so,,,
104,570.24,577.5,4,,,Right my math is right right because thirty plus fifty is then eighty,
105,577.59,583.41,4,,There is weights inserted in here,Like ok that would be this and this right like,
106,584.04,588.3,4,Yeah,A cork or something,All right are we happy with eighty,
107,590.28,597.81,4,,Oh I did not sorry we even convinced you you were wrong too,,
108,598.47,605.07,4,Oh if we do like this we are like doing a weird balancing act we have to go right in the center of mass,,,
109,605.28,620.28,4,,,,Ok for the final part of this task read the scenario and estimate the weight of the missing second mystery block you will have two attempts to estimate and explain your answer you may now continue
110,620.31,623.46,4,,,The factory creates the wooden blocks,
111,623.52,639,4,,,Did not send us the second mystery block you have two oppurtunities to estimate the weight of the second block explain in one to two seconds or one to two sentences how you determined the estimate indicate the weight of the second mystery block,
112,640.35,642.33,4,,,If we're doing fibonnaci yeah sure,
113,643.02,646.29,4,True  ,,But that's what they want us to think,
114,646.59,648.57,4,,,It could be,
115,650.7,664.02,4,,What's our sentence going to be we didn't want to follow the pattern because it was too obvious you know what I mean,Well I um there's two ends to a pattern right there's the lower end and there's the upper end this is not specifying that the mystery block is heavier,
116,664.32,666.48,4,,,The second mystery block could be lighter,
117,666.81,676.26,4,Yeah it's gotta be heavier yeah cause,It can't yeah because the bottom one is ten x is zero,Oh no it did say that there it did say that there in scales of ten,
118,676.68,684.48,4,I said one thirty I feel like we can't overthink it,I agree one thirty because it follows fibonacci,,
119,685.92,690.9,4,,No way caps lock is on a lot,,
120,690.99,695.88,4,,O N A C C I,How do you spell Fibonacci,
121,696,699.6,4,,Oh that looks pretty good actually there might be two ns,,
122,700.2,702.66,4,No no there's,,How do you spell Fibonacci,
123,702.78,704.76,4,I think it's F oh it's that,,,
124,704.97,706.95,4,You can also look it up,I think this is right yeah,,
125,707.4,715.44,4,Yeah,,I don't know I'm just going to leave it like that it follows Fibonacci because it was eighty plus fifty yeah cool alright we happy with that,
126,715.47,718.14,4,,,Cool alright select one thirty yeah,
127,718.38,726,4,,We're done with that one,It is one thirty cool alright we have completed this task,
